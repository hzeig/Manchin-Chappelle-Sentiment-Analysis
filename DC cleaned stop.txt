"both terfsgender critical and rights activists tras have aggressive extremists within the movements as evidenced by the activists who destroyed the mans sign at the that scene i think is symbolic of many conversations with tras any dissent is shut down however terfs have some highly problematic practices as well deadnaming or misgendering individuals thats unacceptable still i appreciate that gender critical spaces allow me to question things without being yelled at or labelled a bigot why is it ok for males to enter female sports why is it transphobic to want to date only cisgendered people", 
"being team terf does not mean you are necessarily transphobic or hate people it means that those particular feminists don\031t view women as true women since they had the luxury of living through in many cases the majority of their lives with the privilege of being male and having a penis women are certainly discriminated against absolutely but they are fighting a different battle than a radical feminist i don\031t agree with any radical feminist don\031t get me wrong anyone who is admittedly radical anything i rarely agree with however they generally battle the inherent benefits of being a biological male and women had that benefit for as long as they lived before their transition that doesn\031t mean they hate women that they don\031t accept them as true women and there is a difference you can accept a woman love a woman fight for rights without believing that that woman has had to endure the same things you have as a biological woman",

"its complicated he doesnt and has never said people are bad or that they dont deserve human rights the problem is that he refuses to acknowledge that their oppression is valid or that they are in fact a vulnerable community that faces violence due to things that are beyond their control in comics parlance this is a concept known as punching down this is a rule in comedy that says that making jokes about someone weaker than you is a bad idea because the audience wont feel comfortable laughing about rape victims or the homeless its meanspirited and cruel to make light of the circumstances of somebody worse off than you its why so many comedians to make jokes about politicians because politicians are powerful you can never punch down at somebody who controls the nuclear codes tries to make the argument that he isnt punching down in the special because he personally sees people as equals worthy of the same rights as himself while that is a noble sentiment its ultimately misplaced the comic making the joke doesnt get to decide through their own enlightenment who is and is not an oppressed community the audience decides and he gravely misjudged his audience in the closer i think it was more due to arrogance on his part than malice but the fact remains that he fucked up big time the jokes he makes arent insightful or particularly funny theyre mean and they feed into a larger transphobic narrative that humiliates and ultimately endangers that community thats what people are talking about when they say its transphobic its not so much what he said as how he said it", 
"norm macdonald colin quinn and others have made it really clear that the rule about punching down is not a comedic rule but something journalists and noncomics say norm specifically gave the example of sam kinison talking about starving kids in africa colin spoke of the punching down idea as a misunderstanding of comedy and said that comedy is not punching but rather play fighting i say this as someone who does not enjoy punching down in comedy and finds it cringy fwiw", "i guess i wouldnt say its an ironclad law of comedy but its a very useful guideline a comics job is to make people laugh not to make them uncomfortable or angry so the rule about punching down is about making sure it stays entertaining for them comedy is about the audience not the comedian some comics skirt that rule using various tricks norm macdonald was certainly very dark but he was careful to pick his targets well he was famous for going after oj simpson a celebrity millionaire for example that wasnt punching down also when he did toe the line he did so with a kind of sly wink to the audience to let them know he knew he was pushing the envelope he was a very cerebral type of comedian and he knew full well what he was doing and he made sure the audience knew it too im not familiar with that particular kinison bit i never was a huge fan of his but he was well known as a guy who was willing to go over the line of good taste to try to get a laugh most comics nowadays that walk the edge generally are very good at going right up to the line and not crossing it unfortunately crossed over this time and this reaction is the natural result of that there are some comics that disdain the very idea of punching down but usually i find them to be out of touch some comedians get so far up their own ass that they blame the audience when they cross a line and get a bad reaction exhibit a bill maher one thing i learned from a veteran comic when i was doing standup is that the audience is never wrong if they dont laugh thats on you and you need to adjust your material to compensate or read the room better some famous comedians especially ones who have done it for a long time get to a point where they feel entitled to laughs and thats imo a fundamental misunderstanding of the art of comedy if they dont find you funny youre probably the problem thats my two cents anyway", 
"thanks for this im not coming from it to defend or advocate anything either but trying to be as objective as i can as a comedy fan that said i also disagree that comics job is not to make people uncomfortable part of the comedic space is to play with things that we cant usually get away with in ordinary discourse and at times its inevitable that a comic may go in directions that make us uncomfortable not those bad guys as you note well its often messy andor inapt comics to provoke esp what they see as piety mongering norm himself had some caitlin jenner jokes as well as one that gently made fun of certain transrights claims i doubt he was transphobic but his punching upwards was to criticize the easy moralisms of the entertainment industrynotice his passionate defense of shane gillis against the twitter mob and if the audience is never wrong then chapelles bit would be ok right since it is a only a vocal minority that didnt it again my point isnt to defend dc as much as resist your comedic rules some thoughts no venom take care", 
"no offense taken i have no problem with friendly discourse i think youre right that comedy can address uncomfortable subjects carlin was famous for making you think in his act but he also made you laugh thats the key not every comedian needs to make you think but every comedian needs to make you laugh otherwise youre monologuing up there thats not standup its making a speech i think thats an important distinction i think its a misconception people have that comedy needs to challenge your expectations or push your boundaries plenty of comics manage to be funny and successful without pushing buttons patton oswalt has never been particularly controversial but i think hes hilarious and his career has gone really well despite never feeling the need to be edgy now that being said being transgressive with your humor is an effective way to get laughs its why so many comics do it there are various ways to get away with pushing the boundaries of good taste but in order to push the limits there have to be limits if everything is acceptable to joke about nothing about controversial comedy would be controversial its those cultural taboos that ultimately make that style of comedy successful because they give the comic something to approach but not directly challenge comedy is in a lot of ways about breaking rules laughter comes from the unexpected and absurd after all comics that find clever ways to break the rules enjoy welldeserved success im always impressed by how daniel tosh and anthony jeselnik manage to get away with taboo humor by being clever about their onstage personas but i think there are and have to be limits if not hard ones that cannot be broken soft ones that can be bent", 
"gti think youre right that comedy can address uncomfortable subjects carlin was famous for making you think in his act but he also made you laugh thats the key not every comedian needs to make you think but every comedian needs to make you laugh otherwise youre monologuing up there thats not standup its making a speech i think thats an important distinction i think its a misconception people have that comedy needs to challenge your expectations or push your boundaries plenty of comics manage to be funny and successful without pushing buttons patton oswalt has never been particularly controversial but i think hes hilarious and his career has gone really well despite never feeling the need to be edgy i agree entirely with this and what you said overall its why certain politicallyminded comics pretty much pander i honestly think dc and norm and others see themselves as pushing back at a certain fashionable piety of the academicentertainment left which is the opposite of pandering much as patrice rip did with certain pieties of feminism but it can veer into things that a sensitive person would balk at as you rightly note take care", 
"i didnt particularly find his special funny but i dont think hes saying people arent oppressed i think hes saying that hes part of a community thats oppressed too so theyre equal why do you think he misjudged his closer audience also which jokes endanger the community", "well to answer the first question i think the uproar over the special speaks pretty clearly about how he misjudged his audience when youre a comedian with his platform his audience is everyone so his failure to read the cultural room of the moment is an issue im willing to bet a lot that he wasnt trying to piss people off with this material when you watch the special hes mostly trying to defend himself against attacks on his prior material i dont see malice there i see ignorance and maybe a stubborn unwillingness to admit he was wrong he does kind of acknowledge that he has had to grow with the times he uses proper pronouns throughout which is something he hasnt always done but i think despite his brushing off twitter as not a real place the criticism does get to him as for the second question the jokes themselves arent the big problem although they are generally callous and unfunny its the fact that theyre piling on to a community that has enough problems right now without one of the most popular comedians in the world making fun of them while he makes an effort to be inclusive and treats his friend with dignity he treats the broader community poorly and that contributes to a cultural environment that puts them in danger he doesnt call for violence but he unintentionally gives fuel to people who might do them harm", 
"ok makes sense thanks", "heres the deal the ignorance shows toward lgbtq people their rights and emotions the terf remark the bias he has against them based on limited negative interactions and the defense he uses i have a friend are all exactly the same as black people have had to endure over the years its ironic that he doesnt see it this way but if a white comedian stood up on stage and made a special saying i dont get the big deal with the n word look at how well their movement is going they are no longer slaves they accomplished more in terms of their rights than women in the last years i have a black friend that killed themselves so i support black people but blm is stupid another commenter here said im team kkk i want to black people but i met this one black guy who robbed me and this other time i met a lazy black guy whats the deal with that are they all that i wanted to enjoy his special ive enjoyed them over the years but maybe im getting old maybe it makes me mad that he got paid millions of dollars to stand up and shit on other minorities there should be no excuse for this the worst part to me is that knows how hard it is for minorities hes been batting for black people his whole life and he still stands up and does a special shitting on other minorities", 
"i think part of it is that he feels that oppression against black americans is fundamentally worse than oppression against other minority groups you can see hints of that philosophy come through in all of his recent specials but none more so than the closer where hes pretty explicit about the idea that nobody has it worse than his group i think its also why he refuses to acknowledge that he can punch down on people as a member of the most oppressed group he cant punch down because he has it worse than everybody else its a deeply flawed line of reasoning but it seems thats the root of his misconceptions about the nature of his jokes and how harmful they are", 
"thats the oppression olympics thats going on everywhere and the only people who benefit from that are oppressors", "to be generous it might be that hes been deeply involved in one fight for equality for a long time and that makes him a little bit narrowly focused he never universalized his arguments", "i think thats probably over generous but i take your point", "no we don\031t we\031re as sick of it as you are", "its funny how hard he plays oppression olympics when his own fanbase are people who are always complaining about how everyone wants to be oppressed nowadays", 
"these are all jokes that have been made before a lot of those \034jokes\035 weren\031t even being made by comedians but by television host and news casters", "i understand which is why these following questions are very important should we subject all minorities to the same growing pains even though weve learned through the hardship of some minorities that its possible to evolve past this kind of behavior does white peoples treatment of black people throughout history make it okay for to make these jokes at the expense of other minorities if yes at what point would it become unacceptable for black people to punch down on other minorities i suspect its the other commenter here said perceives black people to be the ultimate minority and therefore he believes he cant punch down reality is of course more complicated we dont have an ultimate minority and i truly want to live in a world where everyone is treated fairly and i believe many if not most people do", 
"also its worth pointing out that the op is asking what did do wrong and the easiest way to answer that in my opinion is to draw parallels with things people have said in the past about another group that are now deemed incorrect", " he didnt make the distinction between mud slinging accounts on twitter nd most toxic social media and the lgtbq community in general he goes out of his way to address the entire lgbtq community explicitly in his gripes he said that they act minorities until they need to act white around black people he based this off of one bad personal experience he said people make up words to win arguments he said the are out to get him and he needs to look for adams apples he used a huge platform to lie about the community he said jk rowling was cancelled for stating a biological fact first she wasnt cancelled shes still with her publisher still publishing books with crossdressing characters who are murderers if by cancelled he means that people were mean to her on twitter the biggest backlash didnt come out until she lied about someones contract being renewed for purposely not referring to people by their chosen pronoun to be clear not for making a mistake but going out her way to be rude to people directly jk rowling lied and said she was fired for her opinions it was so wrong and inflammatory daniel radcliff went out and made a statement about the whole thing he complained that the lgbtq community is preventing him to from going after white people he said that he had them on the ropes before the lgbtq community stopped him but its who keeps on dedicating his specials to them when his last special was released there were no articles being written about his beef with them no social media trends and then he dedicated nearly his whole special to them and if he wants to get conspiratorial about white people race and sexuality issues look at what they did in india and the philippines they did a ton to demonize homosexuality in those areas they always do the hindymuslim animosity and the caste system in india which existed before the british came but they dialed that the knob up to by codefying into law and making it a part of their educational system and apartheid in south africa they are always pitting minority groups against each other so that they wont focus on their oppressor and i dont see how this could be any more fucking glaring than that the antigay people and antitrans people are the same ones who are antiblm the same people who keep passing laws specifically targeting black people from voting he also complained that dababy got cancelled for being homophobic but not for murder first its always easier for celebrities to attack individuals over attacking minorities the ceo of papa john got cancelled for using the n word roseanne got cancelled for telling a black person she looks a monkey kramer got cancelled for using the n word laura bush got away with running over and killing someone chris brown got away with beating rihanna don king stomped a guy to death and went on to become boxings biggest promoter robert richards heir to the dupont company was convicted of raping his daughter and served no jail time attacks on individuals dont elicit the media attention racism and homophobia do but this is somehow the fault of the lgbtq community furthermore social media backlash isnt a strong indicator of the extent to which systemic racism and homophobia is being addressed in our society theres a still record high killings of people police can still largely murder black people and face no legal repercussions actual cancellations from social media backlash are when corporations stop doing business with a person because their image no longer brings in the same revenue as when they hired them this never really challenges the root power structures and phobias in our society it doesnt matter how many celebrities throw their careers in toilet it wont affect systemic racism in policing he complained to what extent am i obligated to participate in your self image he has none but to what extent are they obligated to indulge in the idea that he is beyond criticism to what extent should they suppress the fact that he is no longer a positive influence in their life he complained about people using made up words to win arguments but the majority of the terms that were coined for identifying phenomena regarding the marginalization of minorities came from the racial equality movements its mostly the antiblm people who criticize people for using terms microaggressions he blamed the lgbtq community for taking away kevin harts childhood dream of hosting the oscars first off his old jokes were hurtful don lemon did a great job of explaining why im not going to link the youtube videos because that tends to get my comment deleted by the automod but ill mention what to look up on youtube youtube don lemmon kevin hart and kevin hart later acknowledges at much saying that he has grown since youtube kevin hart apology but the issue is that he was adamant in not addressing it twice but he never apologized the first time he never apologized in every single interview he did about his hurtful comments prior to the oscars he defended himself each and every time until google the vulturecom article titled where are kevin hart\031s past apologies an investigation if hosting the oscars truly was kevins childhood dream and giving an apology and instead lying about previously apologizing was a boundary then he has a brittleass spirit daves phrase for louisck victims btw by his own usage of the terminology tried to cancel don lemon youtube don lemmon responds to regarding his friends death he cited her arguments on twitter as a possible cause for her death im going to skip over the point that twitter arguments bring the worst out of people in general and not lgbtq people im not going to buy that story because said it maybe its true and maybe someone else can confirm it but from the way lied about the kevin hart and jk rowling backlash im not going to believe his story purely from his take on her situation exclaims look how well the lgbtq movement is going as a comparison to the racial equality movement there are instances where it may be useful to compare movements to better understand varying methods of minority marginalization but this discussion is wholly incomplete without the discussion of areas where they are not comparable because systems of oppression uses different tactics to oppress different groups in chappelles own home state of ohio they passed a law that allows doctors to deny lgbtq people health care on moral grounds in states there are no explicit statewide laws at all protecting people from discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity in employment housing and public accommodations which means in over half the country you can be fired or denied housing for being gay or conversion therapy is legal in states texas banned a suicide hotline for lgbtq youths i dont think was homophobictransphobic in his initial specials he had some cognitive biases which resulting in him saying some hurtful stuff but his refusal to accept any criticism and the resulting backlash has resulted in a full blown fear gt phobia of lgbtq people besides the good ones who are his friends its similar to a type of racism many white people have today they believe in the idea of equality in general but think the black community are people hateful to white people when the kneel for the anthem and criticize the police they use isolated incidents looting and random youtube videos to characterize the whole black community they think the average black person has more privilege than the average white person by pointing to people being cancelled by racism the way points to people being cancelled for homophobia they think black people are misguided in how they address systemic racism and i feel feels similarly about how lgbtq address systemic homophobia and transphobia wants full equality for lgbtq people but he didnt want them to address the very hurtful comments made by kevin hart or jk rowling he doesnt want them to call out people for using slurs he complained about not being able to use the fword slur he also implied that the idea of the lgbtq calling themselves my people is racist but at the end of the special used that exact phrase to refer to his fellow comedians stop punching down on my people he always tries to pit the lgbtq community against the black community he complains about why is it easier for bruce jenner to change his gender than it was for cassius clay to change his name people existed in the s and throughout history it wasnt easier it took years after the stonewall riots which actually referenced in his special but why do this dumb game wants us to play does a person with cancer need to complain every time theres a breakthrough in aids research if his point is that the rich white power structures in our country are using lgbtq issues to put down black people then he should go after the white power structures in our country directly and specifically maybe there are pockets of lgbtq people putting down black people peter theil but largely the white power structures strategy is to pit marginalized grounds against each other the same people trying to put homophobia and transphobia into our school curriculum are the same ones who are trying to prevent black people from voting says lgbtq people act minorities until its convenient for them not to but hes is doing exactly that with his cisheteromale privilege to wage with his fellow millionaire celebrities", 
"im and i totally agree with you and i want to continue first your third to last paragraph about jenner should probably be put in quotes i dont think you believe that about her but you kinda accidentally phrased it that way i had an argument with a guy as to why if i called him ugly he couldnt call me a fgtaggotlt i told him its because thats what they shout at us before killing us links dude who told you the cops were on our side we witness it talk to each other but cops dont necessarily put it in their reports i also agree with dababy getting away with murder being bullshit but it reminded me of al capone he did far worse things but was ultimately jailed for tax fraud hey the outcome was still the same well take what we can get transphobes often cite us making up words neglecting to explain how any other word forms one guy pointed rock and suddenly made up a new word", 
"heres a good breakdown httpswwwredditcomrnewscommentsqwgxnetflixfiresemployeeforsharingconfidentialhgtgcg", "best sections in my opinion its similar to a type of racism many white people have today they believe in the idea of equality in general but think the black community are people hateful to white people when the kneel for the anthem and criticize the police they think the average black person has more privilege than the average white person and point to people being cancelled by racism the way points to people being cancelled for homophobia they think black people are misguided in how they address systemic racism and i feel feels similarly about how lgbtq address systemic homophobia and transphobia if his point is that the rich white power structures in our country are using lgbtq issues to put down black people then he should go after the white power structures in our country directly maybe there are pockets of lgbtq people putting down black people peter theil but largely the white power structures strategy is to pit marginalized grounds against each other the same people trying to put homophobia and transphobia into our school curriculum are the same ones who are trying to prevent black people from voting all credit to ucockgoblinreturns", 
"what a comment im flabbergasted that people still defend over this", "because its not really that great of a breakdown despite the wall of text", "the whole team terf and jk rowling thing is the equivalent of a white comedian saying he supports blm and talking about the horrors poc face then saying they are team kkk and that race is a fact and then justify it by saying they had a black friend who would defend your statements who killed themselves and that makes it ok while he said protrans things he also said very antitrans things it mostly comes from the misunderstanding that gender and sex are different its also offensive because the punchline of the jokes was that someone is you can make jokes about the experience most people do going through a second puberty in adulthood can be pretty funny much does with the black experience but thats not what most of the special was", 
"gtteam terf is the equivalent of a white comedian saying he supports blm and then saying they are team kkk and that race is a fact you are correct in comparing terfs to the kkk because terfs do not understand transpeople they hate natal males and wrongly spout that are all perverts this is harmful but more importantly it is incorrect it uses a double standard of logic lgb sexualities are okay but t sexualities are somehow perverted and invalid however in the rest of your comment theres a wild difference between being team kkk and saying race is a fact i havent seen anybody get offended over andme tests yet there actually are myriad reasons to get offended over andme because geneticsrace are always presented from a eurocentric false reality but even if you got rid of the eurocentrism the genetic differences would still exist and acknowledging the existence of those differences does not make you racist now extend this logic to transpeople there are in of cases two different biological sexes transpeople wish to be the opposite sex of course a male can never truly become a female in the same way that a person of european ancestry can never become genetically japanese however if a male does wish to be female and she takes steps to emulate women visually and culturally then i think that society owes it to her to not socially degrade her the race equivalent of this would be a poc assimilating to european culture and also not being socially degraded however acknowledging the difference between an african person and a european in a respectful way is not racism and the transequivalent would also not be transphobia", 
"thank you for your response and it seems for the most part we agree race is a fact i guess couldve been worded differently but i would to note race is a social construct in fact academia doesnt use the term race and instead use clines since its a gradient rather than a cut and dry thing i guess a better equivalent would be saying something eugenics is a fact or some other form of scientific racism as an aside transracialism is an interesting debate but since there isnt any data on individuals having racial dysphoria to even a fraction of a percentage individuals experience gender dysphoria again gender not sex they identify as a different gender at this time its kinda a moot point", 
"its also worth mentioning that sex is a far far more fundamental division than race there are millions of different races most of them now extinct or mixed and the ones that exist today are simply mixes of the old ones race is multidimensional sex is largely a dichotomy you can be north or southeast asian indian african european north african american native etc et al but for sex you are only male or female for of cases race can blend sex cant parents of different races form a genetic intermediate between them parents of different sexes formeither sons or daughters for this reason i dont support having transgender athletes in womens competitions but i do support bathroom choice and usage of appropriate himher pronouns the multidimensional ximxer pronouns are silly it would be me insisting that everyone remember every weird quirk and hobby that i have", 
"i mean thats only because thats how we socially constructed it now that its widely known there are far more than two sexes intersex turner syndrome etc and also again noting that gender is different than sex and is also a spectrum whose to say we dont see blendings of sex we actually have quite a bit of evidence that athletes arent a problem httpswwwncbinlmnihgovpmcarticlespmc gtgtmetaanalysis covering prior research on individuals\031 performance in sports and preexisting sports policies concerning people gtgtfindings show there is no consistent or direct research indicating transgender women have an unfair athletic advantage at any stage of their transition gtgtadditional findings show most sports policies are not evidencebased and individuals experience substantial discrimination from sports institutions neopronouns to me are a nickname theres no negative to me calling someone ximxer and theres only positives from the other person so i dont really see an issue", 
"it\031s very telling that a major part of his special and the reason for the special existing was due to a friend in the industry who killed herself weeks after defending him in public and getting a ton of hate from her own community i\031m sure is laughing at the hypocrisy and the irony right now because those who needed to make that connection and see it are now seeing it and those who are screaming about him and trying to get him cancelled are proving the point he was trying to make and none of this outrage has called attention to his dead friend despite being a unique and special opportunity to give all this press towards awareness", 
"gt it\031s very telling that a major part of his special and the reason for the special existing was due to a friend in the industry who killed herself one week after defending him in public and getting a ton of hate from her own community i mean that is his framing also one week is inaccurate she defended him first and then as a result he let her open for him without further information this framing is as valid as framing her suicide being due to how bad she bombed infront of her hero when opening for him making her suicide more of his fault both these theories are equally valid or in this case invalid given the fact that has completely lied about the jkrowling situation in order to make his point look better it seems to me that we cannot trust whoever he is blaming for her suicide", 
"you\031re saying she\031s as likely to kill herself because she bombed a gig something that eventually turned into a conversation between her and while he was on stage which morphed into her getting a huge ovation by the end of the night and an offer to open for him some more over getting bullied and shamed online by her own peers should we conjure up her ghost so you can gaslight it", "yes both is as likely since for one we only have the word of a proven liar and for the other we have the word of a proven liar both are baseless speculation", 
"i\031m taking into account the disgusting things i watched sent to her online by people from her own community and the words of her family and friends keep tearing the city up and trying to get standup specials ripped off streaming services and we\031ll see how much good that does our lgbt community in the long run", "gt keep tearing the city up keep tearing the city up what are you talking about you are losing it lol", "protests where people are getting assaulted over this currently", "assaulted are you for real way worse shit happens every time there is a sporting event people protest its their right do you wanna cancel them", 
"\034this is bad too so we should accept this\035 i\031m not saying they shouldn\031t i\031m saying they\031re fighting against their own purpose", "most of the people criticising him openly admit they didnt watch the whole thing for me he was trying to make a broader point about all discrimination and how every group has made strides in some areas and are still discriminated against in others while making the point that the community in the western world have made bigger strides towards equality in a shorter time frame than most other discriminated groups in the last years comedians say controversial stuff they always have and im all for comedy pretty much without limits some people will be offended by certain things but thats the world we live in", 
"terf is short for \034 exclusionary radical feminist\035 it\031s a group that argues that women are oppressed solely or primarily due to their biology and early socialization and therefore people with different biology and early socialization people can never be women however this ends up reducing womanhood to their bodies and the female gender role\024the very thing that feminism fights against for a more detailed rebuttal than i can fit in this comment i recommend this videohttpsyoutubeptpuogjqsi terfs are one of the main antitrans groups who seek to dehumanize people deny access to genderaffirming healthcare and strip away legal protections for gender identity so when says he\031s \034team terf\035 he\031s allying himself with all of that", 
" is saying hes a terf because he believes that biology is factual hes saying that people can never be women because they are menthat is people with the xy chromosome configuration women are people with the xx chromosome configuration hes not saying that people dont exist or arent oppressed in some ways he wants to keep the facts straight thats why his closing line addressed to daphnes daughter is your father was a wonderful woman", "nothing angry people protecting their horrible thoughts unto others", 
"not but half the special seemed him using daphne as a prop to validate that what he\031s saying about people is okay because his one friend is okay with it and it was kind of gross how he ended with giving himself a pat on the back for donating money to daphne\031s daughter it took me a week to watch this entire special because it was so cringe it was hard to watch i remember being less preachy and more funny but maybe i was wrong", "nothing peeps to bitch and moan", "nothing people get offended over harmless jokes", 
"op this is whats harmful about he is a comedian so people can take his bigoted position and dismiss the genuine harms done to people as them being offended", "hes a comedian and his job is to make fun of the human condition its quite literally a form of art i actually cannot believe we are living in a time where western democracies are arguing for the censorship of artistic practice because its offensive if comedians cant make fun of race religion sexual orientation gender identity well thats a stupid society to live in", 
"first nobody is arguing for censorship stop being dramatic second being a comedian has never saved anyone from public recourse ever imagine if kramer or whatever got to scream the nword and get a multimillion dollar deal to save your art third he made specific statements that are incorrect andor misguided thats on him if someone is a comedian saying that any group of people are invalid people are allowed to respond to that", "i\031m not the one being dramatic comedy is art having a group of people offended about inaccurate comedic statements attempt to force the removal of that artistic content is properly terrifying", 
"yeah so is trying to other us thats how we get murdered and go back to having no rights but sure sweetie go off about art", "theyre jokes theyre not serious whats so hard to understand about that", "well for starters jokes are supposed to be funny and only one joke was funny also invalidating people is serious whats so hard to understand about that", "whether a joke is funny or not is subjective you are not the arbiter of comedy nobody is whats funny to you may not be funny to others and vice versa maybe you didnt find it funny thats fine but flat out saying only one joke was funny is a very arrogant and selfcentered way to look at it if youre invalidated by a comedian youve never even met maybe you need to get a life and learn to stop caring about the opinions of strangers your life and livelihood arent going to be affected by a comedian the people who believe that kind of stuff seriously already believed it before said it",

"other than the one comment i said to my wife and this one i\031m writing now i haven\031t really talked about the special it\031s not funny and it reeks of a guy who is trying to explain why the lgbtq community has it better than black people and why he isn\031t transphobic the thing i love about comedy is the tendency is self deprecation and self humour and feels the opposite now people have called him the goat for so long that he sounds entitled i wasn\031t aware of any controversy but i totally understand why people might think it\031s a bit cunty", 
"this was pretty much my take away as well for all the hate and criticism the worst part of the special was that it was really mediocre work his social commentary was accurate about as often as it was offbase and hes a comedian so yeah he doesnt step lightly and its gonna offend people but through and through the closer wasnt very funny im glad the guy is taking time off and stepping back from lgbtq stuff because more and more lately hes not producing stuff that makes me laugh and it has less to do with offending me and more to do with the jokes being weak the one thing i will say is that treats the lgbtq movement as a total monolith in his work and thats a really poor interpretation of things the community experiences far more discrimination and hate than other groups and if you hear tell it theyve got the world at their fingertips this misconception along with a lot of unwillingness to grapple with the fact that black lgbtq folks get so much hate from their own community and how his comedy can impactreinforce this isnt a great look in the end demonstrates a lot of ignorance on the issues but simultaneously shows empathy and offers a valuable perspective at times its complicated but i came away from the special thinking it isnt very good but it isnt as horrific as it was made out to be mostly i came away thinking this wasnt very funny", 
"agreed do i think he\031s transphobic probably not but if i was a person and i don\031t the way he\031s treating people would my criticism be valid probably i don\031t think white people get to decide what is racist against black people so why would a cis person get to decide what isn\031tis transphobic i heard a another smarter person say \034he doesn\031t understand that you can be oppressed and the oppressor\035 she likened it to white women not identifying with poc because women have been oppressed as well",

"which is why ive never gotten into a lot of social commentary comedians i feel people only play them up because they agree with them not because theyre actually funny i could list names but i dont wanna be maimed", "i kind of felt it was going this way from all his last specials they were pretty good but man the times they were bad or kind of cringe kept getting longer i guess", "yeah i think some of the points he made were good and important in a vacuum and others werent but in his special it comes across bitter it wasnt much of a comedy his previous specials were much better", 
"there is plenty and i agree with it there are plenty of issues to address with social progression and there are plenty of extreme views on the left that are ridiculous and dangerous as there are on the right but whatever the nuances of chappelles views are the comedy hes been putting out recently are stupid lazy rants that use the cover of joking to whine about lgbtq minorities not being proper minorities yes white privilege is a phenomenon that extends into other minority struggles including black american politics light skinned black people are broadly more palatable in the media and society than dark skinned black people but his focus seems to be on denigrating all lgbtq issues and taking the piss out of any of them that are too far away from what hes deemed ok and the fact is hes not acting as a comedian hes ranting about his own opinions and many comedians do but it means noone can play the jokes card whenever hes called out one of the last things he said was im not going to say any more on this issue till im convinced the community and i are laughing together or something along those lines and yet after he wrote that as the closing sentiment of his show he still delivered the whole show first on taking the piss out of various lgbtq stuff before closer actually closed what a little bitch way to do things did you see his bit on the woman who was allegedly trying to bait into acting out on camera", 
"the biggest criticism i have of is that ever since show stopped his entire schtick is \034people don\031t me and they don\031t wanna hear my jokes\035 and it\031s not very funny it wasn\031t funny when seinfeld did it either", "he is getting a lot of criticism not because of the antitrans remarks but also because many comedians feel the special was masturbatory and poorly done a comedian has come out to say she has a laundry list of criticisms regarding his comedy not his personal politics", "ive made this point else where butthis dude has an incredible platform he had a huge comeback three specials minutes of his special was dedicated to peoples response to his last special you dont make a special either he has been touring for years talking endlessly about people it seems to be something with terfs they go nuts and get obsessed stop talking about it its not that interesting",

"yeah thats another issue i agree with basically everything george carlin said and believed but the standup specials he was doing toward the end of his career were unbearable it wasnt comedy it was the church of carlin a dude ranting in a slightly clever way isnt really comedy i think what irritates me most about chappelles special apart from being transphobic is that he wont own up to it the dude is so bothered by criticism that he wrote and performed a fucking hour long special to defend himself the entire hour was about one topic technically two and how hes actually not an asshole by the last minutes he literally was not telling jokes preaching his opinion",

"exactly this bill burr mentioned something to this effect recently he feels the pandemic made him a better comic because he was forced to do awkward outdoor and virtual gigs that made it harder to win laughs the crowd wasn\031t automatically into it which is also how it is early in a comic\031s career they get worse over time if they aren\031t vigilant", "i will say one downside to ubiquitous cell phones is that it makes it harder to workshop your material i saw george carlin live and he was working up material for his next special he flat out told the audience at the beginning im about halfway through the process some stuff wont land i did eventually see the special a year or so later about familiar although the pacing and phrasing had changed in a lot of the stuff i recognized some of that was to make jokes land better some of it was clearly to add edge take off edge or otherwise tweak a joke because good comedians walk a pretty fine line carlin could afford to work up a whole set mostly from scratch but i suspect any comedian trials new jokes and timings when theyre on the road trying to find something that lands on the right side of the line for their audience cut off comics from audiences though and you tend to get really selfreferential bullshit that walks the comedians and his friends line and can leave the audience cold",

"being is not inherently funny but i believe its possible for comedians to write jokes about things that arent funny granted it takes talent and nuance and often it comes from people closest to that issue can write jokes about racism which is also not inherently funny that people affected by racism still laugh at and enjoy he failed to find that kind of joke about people despite devoting the majority of the specials time to the subject as a woman i want someone to find the humor in this\024it would be therapeutic cathartic but its always the same categories of jokes no matter how skilled the comedian is on other topics its attack helicopters and chopping dicks off and oh no that person didnt have the parts i was expecting its tall deepvoiced women introducing themselves with feminine names or in the case of daves special someone at the urinal with genitals you wouldnt expect the mismatch between someones expressed gender and their body and thats supposed to be the whole joke this person being who they are\024funny right but for a topic that isnt inherently funny that doesnt work or rather it only works on people who already find the situation inherently funny\024ie transphobes and those jokes say to the transphobes dont worry you can still be transphobic because youre right were all laughing and cringing alongside you nobody takes them seriously thats what punching down is its not joking about the marginalized the helpless the oppressed its telling jokes for the majority the powerful the oppressors is supposed to be this great talent but all he had were the same jokes i could hear from anyone a hundred times a day if i asked what people thought about me he doesnt need to be canceled in my opinion he needs to get better material",

"nah its pretty clear from watching the special that hes protrans but hes not knowledgable about the topic enough so he contradicts his own message he literally comes out against republican bath room bills that dont let people use the bathroom of the gender they identify with but its pretty clear that he didnt understand why people were mad at rowling since on the surface theres nothing wrong with what she said its the anti dog whistles that make it bad he basically fell for terf rhetoric that pretends people think sex aint real so he basically thinks rowling was cancelled for saying sex is real but he conflated sex and gender so his message basically was if saying sex is real makes you a terf then guess im a terf",

"if you consider the timeline it really is a huge stretch to suggest the twitter crowd led her to commit suicide rather than she made her twitter post defending more than a month before she committed suicide she opened for less than two weeks before she committed suicide it seems a lot more likely the more recent thing was the likely cause especially given what said of it", "yeah unfortunately we will never know but i\031d bet cash you\031re right", "she isolated herself from her community to defend the guy who hired her and then he shit all over her leaving her alone",

"wow yeah this is actually a really good point", "but thats not why he walked away from all that he hated to see his comedy be so commoditized that it was robbed of its actual meaning and point and then to become such an authority on all he makes his shows about that literally he cannot make a joke about something in a manner he uses as material anyways plus to see his own material used to exploit his own people contribute to another system of pure exploitation incidentally contribute to the hollywood system by continuing to work in it etc a finer point that i heard him mention on in the actors studio was that he didnt feel good about the comedy that he was making as it wasnt facilitating truth and reconciliation between people further defining the other and reinforcing the same issues he was pointing out if you listen to his material in its context you would know to not take his material at face value it serves to showcase an exaggerated viewpoint to see the hypocrisy of being sensitive while not observing or understanding subtly because everything is so exaggerated lately that no one can say anything publicly without it getting exaggerated personally i think hes doing the same thing again drawing the public eye to a problem the only way he knows how making jokes and material that is potentially more genuine and thought provoking and showcasing the subtlety required to discuss such things in public everything gets exaggerated though which stops productive discussion in its tracks because subtle differences is kinda what defines everyone and is therefore universal calling out identity politics on the way of course because no one is only one thing but everyone is human and has struggles those struggles are different for everyone i dont see him being genuinely understood for a while not while our global culture cant universally understand nuance", 
"perhaps his old comedy did that but youve seen the actual material in his new special there is no subtly or nuance hes pretty directly complaining that hes being criticized and then doubled down by calling himself a terf and repeating the same talking points that antitrans folks use against the community but i think that people desperately want to hold comedians to this standard of modern public intellectuals where every joke is some rich and thoughtful critique on modern society when in reality theyre trying to make people laugh while sometimes using the stage as their own therapist couch", 
"this was a big issue i had with later sets of lewis black his early stuff was brilliant and insightful but then i saw him live towards the end of his career and despite me being a huge fan that i drove hours to see him i could only summarize his set as old many yells at clouds even without the stuff his sets are mediocre at best now there is no real point or message an old man complaining about the way times have changed toss him up there with jerry seinfeld and mike meyers complaining that people dont find tired ass jokes from years ago funny anymore", 
"id agree with you that hes dispensed with the subtlety but if you cant hear the specific distinctions he says in his new stuff all of it and understand the absolutely non broad stroke references he makes theres far more nuance than you seem to observe specifically distinguishing between movements and people also you final point works with some comedians but not with id even argue never used comedy a public therapy session watch his show it was always about societal observations", "gthe saw first hand that jokes can actually be harmful even if that wasnt the intent yet is now blind to that because its something that doesnt directly affect him you gtbut thats not why he walked away from all that also you gtplus to see his own material used to exploit his own people do you see the contradiction do you see why youre wrong and ranting aimlessly to hear yourself self congratulate over thinking you understand nuance you dont that people disagree with so you start talking completely blind to the fact that you actually agree with that persons point you immediately shot down", 
"this is the nuance that i was talking about its not a contradiction because as his jokes got commercialized they turned into something else he mostly left because he saw that he was simply contributing to the hollywood system of artist exploration and saw the damage it was doing to himself and while away he saw that he couldnt control and make money off of his own stuff and his jokes werent landing the way he wanted as a result there were many reasons he left some which might sound contradictory if taken out of context so maybe you should watch the source material i cited before doing exactly that inside the actors studio a brushing can evolve and still master after its evolution there was a reason i posted there and not above since you dont seem to get the intent of replies while i was agreeing with him the main reason he left is what i started above and it wasnt a simple one nor the one the original reply meant i dont mind that people disagree with him i dont agree with him on some things myself but when its obvious that most arent taking the time to understand the points he makes and take his stuff out of context it ironically proved his point you did for me there", 
"when he laughed it made me uncomfortable says as a matter of fact that was the last thing i shot before i told myself i gotta take f time out after this because my head almost exploded that was when he left he took time off did an interview with time and at that point he was unsure if he was coming back but the reason he needed time off was because of his feeling that his jokes were having a harmful effect and he didnt want those skits released their violation of that is also a contributing factor in why he chose to not return but again it stemmed from the skits and that laughter giving him that feeling i understand his points i understand why the laughter can subtly be the difference between the racist pixie being seen as ones persistent inner conscience theyre trying to deny rather than the personification of racism and its effect on internal thoughts causing a weird sort of guilt he fails to appreciate that when its not his group", 
"eh two entirely different things hes not advocating to cancel others because hes offended as far as i can remember he has never done that besides asking fans to not watch show under hbo which is still different because its a personal grudge not a this company said something offensive so boycott them his quitting the show was his personal feeling that he didnt how some people were reacting to his material he felt uncomfortable and so he quit his job that is in no way saying that comedians should be cancelled for a subjectively bad joke", 
"and this is getting downvoted wow", "because its a silly distinction it is not two entirely different things the effect is the same", "its not the effect that he said is different the reason edit btw i think daves jokes were not that great in this special it was way too personal for him and it visibly hurt him to be labeled as hateful by so many people and i didnt dig the comedian friend but being dragged into this either although i understand that he wanted to put the story in the spotlight the way he did it is suboptimal at best although i do agree that people are being beought into this world by women and are fathered by men people can call themselves anything they want feel themselves to be whatever they want but dont force others to change terminology and bend language to your ideas in my opinion", 
"the world must be much simpler in black and white if you cant see the difference between quitting because youre upset vs being fired because someone else is upset theres no point in talking", "gt if you cant see the difference between quitting because youre upset vs being fired because someone else is upset theres no point in talking he cancelled the show and all the associated workers because he was offended by how someone else was laughing at him not with him he doesnt want to be cancelled because other people are offended because he is laughing at them not with him you are definitely correct about no point in talking though", 
"its what happens when you disagree with the popular opinion in any given thread", "did you watch the special that was his closing point he said he\031s done making jokes about the lgbtq community until he was sure they were all laughing together", "gtdid you watch the special the only comeback to criticism ah they disagree clearly they didnt watch it otherwise theyd agree with gt he said he\031s done making jokes about the lgbtq community until he was sure they were all laughing together and yet spent an entire hr making jokes about them you dont get to rant for an hr and then be its cool im done now that ive said everything i wanted to about this topic wanna make sure we all good if he understood he wouldnt do it in the first place",

"i am not familiar with this theory you are attributing to bailey and cant easily find an article on baileys faculty page that espouses the theory you mention i would generally not go out of my way to defend everything hes ever written and he would certainly not be the first sexologist to publish questionable findings but i am at least not aware of his falsifying data in the same vein as say masters and johnson in their notorious work on homosexuality or john money in his study of intersexuals i also would tend to not view one wacky theory as a discrediting factor especially if the positor is open to rebuttal i am not an expert in bailey specifically i know of him from the internet nonsense which centers on discrediting him in his area of expertise psychology because of his book on women which to my knowledge has not been discredited by anyone who isnt an activist im not a huge fan of the idea of seeing homosexuality as something that is caused by parasites born this way all the way but i do believe in the academic process you air the dumb theory present your evidence then another person contradicts with a new theory the main potential issue i can see is if we decide to discredit all empirical science that doesnt fit specific political narratives because i think its dangerous to let politics dictate what research can and cant do could we please stick to merit please rhetorical not directed at you specifically but the people who think we should withdraw peerreviewed articles from the jama for woke points edited one word i had written ama instead of jama im tired yall", 
"welp further research and discussion has made me realise i made a mistake apologies the \034research\035 i was referencing was greg cochran\031s not bailey\031s with almost no evidence cochran said that homosexuality must originate from pathogens because there\031s no evolutionary reason for it to exist it\031s a crock of shit and likely influenced more by cochran\031s own politics than any scientific rigour bailey did publicly offer tepid support for the theory essentially saying \030it\031s possible  b\017 support which cochran shouted from the rooftop and used to bolster his hypothesisbut bailey did also acknowledge it was essentially untestable bailey did make cochran\031s work required reading in an undergraduate class at northwestern which is pretty wild but not necessarily an endorsement likely him playing devil\031s advocate", 
"thats pretty interesting i did see from baileys website that he thinks there are likely substantial environmental factors that likely cause homosexual orientation which again i cant say i love for myself and my view of the world but hes interested in potential epigenetic causes which would be in line with things blanchards male birth order theory and i am not terribly old but i am old enough to remember the male birth order theory being used both for and against the born this way argument before blanchard became demonized i think its important to look at some of the questionable things sometimes at the very least to substantiate why we continue to call them questionable",

entire lgbtq community explicitly he said that they act minorities until they need to act white around black people he based this off of one bad experience he had with them he joked how he had to look out for people he said people make up words to win arguments he used a huge platform to lie about the community is punching down in his last special he said jk rowling was cancelled for stating a biological fact first she wasnt cancelled shes still with her publisher still publishing books with characters who are murderers if by cancelled he means that people were mean to her on twitter the biggest controversy didnt come out until she lied about someones contract being renewed for purposely not referring to people by their chosen pronoun not making a mistake but going out her way to be rude to people she interacts with jk rowling said she was fired for her opinions twitter uses have characters has a longform format on one of the biggest platforms on the world and hes using it to lie about the lgbtq community thats what punching down means but to punching down on him is critiquing his demand to use a homophobic slur the f word something he never got cancelled for can not go on twitter if he doesnt want to hear about the people he makes upset but thats not good enough for him he complained that the lgbtq community is preventing him to from going white people that he had them on the ropes before the lgbtq community its who keeps on dedicating his specials to them when his last special was released there were no articles being written about his beef with them no social media trends and then he dedicated nearly his whole special to them and if he wants to get conspiratorial about white people race and sexuality issues look at what they did in india and the philippines they did a ton to demonize homosexuality in those areas they always do the caste system in india and apartheid in south africa they are always pitting minority groups against each other so that they wont focus on their oppressor and i dont see how this could be any more fucking glaring that the antigay people and antitrans people are the same ones who are antiblm he also complained that dababy got cancelled for being homophobic but not for murder first its always easy for celebraties for attacking minorities than for attacking individuals the ceo of papa john got cancelled for using the n word roseanne got cancelled for telling a black person she looks a monkey barbara bush got away with running over someone chris brown got away with beating rihanna but most of this is out of the hands of the lgbtq community futhermore social media backlash isnt a strong indicator of the extent to which systemic racism and homophobia is being addressed in our society theres a still record high killings of people police and still largely murder black people and face no legal repercussions he complained to what extent am i obligated to participate in your self image you have none but to what extent are they obligated to indulge in the idea that you are beyond criticism he complained about people using made up words to win arguments when it was terfs who coined that term specifically to identify themselves as those who exclude people from their efforts also the majority of the terms that were coined for identifying phenomena regarding the marginalization of minorities came from the racial equality movement its mostly the antiblm people who criticize people for using terms microaggressions he blamed the lgbtq community for taking away kevin harts childhood dream of hosting the oscars first off his old jokes were hurtful don lemon did a great job of explaining why httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvmbnyddpkcbo httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvccdtefwhny and kevin hart later acknowledges at much saying that he has grown since httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvqwgrfwwi but the issue is that he was adamant in not addressing it twice but he never apologized the first time every interview he did about it he defended himself httpswwwvulturecomkevinharthomophobictweetsapologiesellendegenereshtml btw by his own usage of the terminology tried to cancel don lemon httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvobinyneyo i dont think was homophobictransphobic in his initial specials he had some cognitive biases which resulting in him saying some hurtful stuff but his refusal to accept any criticism and the resulting backlash has resulted in a full blown fear gt phobia of lgbtq people besides the good ones who are his friends its similar to a type of racism many white people have today they believe in the idea of equality in general but think the black community are people hateful to white people when the kneel for the anthem and criticize the police they think black people are misguided in how they address systemic racism and i feel feels similarly about how lgbtq address systemic homophobia and transphobia specifically made comments about the sufferings of people about unjust bathrooms laws so its hard to talk about this on the only major medium people have to discuss this twitter characters most of the responses are you didnt watch the special wants full equality for lgbtq people but he didnt want them to address the very hurtful jokes made by kevin hart or the comments by jk rowling he doesnt want them to call out people for using sluts he complained about not being able to use the fword slur he also implied that the idea of the lgbtq calling themselves my people is racist but at the end of the special used that exact phrase to refer to his fellow comedians stop punching down on my people he always tries to pit the lgbtq community against the black community he complains about why is it easier for bruce jenner to change his gender than it was for cassius clay to change his name does a

httpswwwnytimescomopiniondavechappellenetflixtranshtmlhttpswwwnytimescomopiniondavechappellenetflixtranshtml we generally have the same debates about comedy over and over let\031s address those upfront art should be made without restriction free speech reigns supreme sometimes good art should make us uncomfortable and sometimes bad people can make good art comedians in particular are going to punch up and down and sidetoside also true comedy is not above criticism even if the most famous wildly wealthy comedians will keep insulting those who question them it\031s laughs right lighten up all criticism is forestalled with this setup in which when you object to anything a comedian says you\031re the problem you\031re the one who\031s narrowminded or \034brittle\035 or humorless \034shut up\035 recalls telling a woman who had the gall to challenge his comedy using a sexist slur and laughing at how witty he is as if he\031s the first man to ever deliver such an original funny line \034before i kill you and put you in the trunk ain\031t nobody around here\035 the audience cheers before mr explains that he didn\031t in fact threaten the woman \034i felt that way but that\031s not what i said i was more clever than that\035 mr spends much of \034the closer\035 his latest comedy special for cleverly deflecting criticism the set is a minute display of the comedian\031s own brittleness the selfproclaimed \034goat\035 greatest of all time of standup delivers five or six lucid moments of brilliance surrounded by a joyless tirade of incoherent and seething rage misogyny homophobia and transphobia if there is brilliance in \034the closer\035 it\031s that mr makes obvious but elegant rhetorical moves that frame any objections to his work as unreasonable he\031s being \034brutally honest\035 he\031s saying the quiet part out loud he\031s stating \034facts\035 he\031s making us think but when an entire comedy set is designed as a series of strategic moves to say whatever you want and insulate yourself from valid criticism i\031m not sure you\031re really making comedy throughout the special mr is singularly fixated on the lgbtq community as he has been in recent years he reaches for every lowhanging piece of fruit and munches on it gratuitously many of mr \031s rants are extraordinarily dated the kind of comedy you might expect from a conservative boomer agog at the idea of homosexuality at times his voice lowers to a hoarse whisper preparing us for a grand stroke of wisdom \024 but it never comes every once in a while he remarks that oh boy he\031s in trouble now a mischievous little boy who can\031t help himself somewhere buried in the nonsense is an interesting and accurate observation about the white gay community conveniently being able to claim whiteness at will there\031s a compelling observation about the relatively significant progress the lgbtq community has made while progress toward racial equity has been much slower but in these formulations there are no gay black people mr pits people from different marginalized groups against one another callously suggesting that people are performing the gender equivalent of blackface in the next breath mr says something about how a black gay person would never exhibit the behaviors to which he objects an assertion many would dispute the poet saeed jones for example wrote in gq that watching \034the closer\035 felt a betrayal \034i felt i\031d been stabbed by someone i once admired and now he was demanding that i stop bleeding\035 later in the show mr offers rambling thoughts on feminism using a webster\031s dictionary definition further exemplifying how limited his reading is he makes a tired tired joke about how he thought \034feminist\035 meant \034frumpy dyke\035 \024 and hey i get it if i were on his radar he would consider me a frumpy dyke or worse some may consider that estimation accurate fortunately my wife doesn\031t then in another of those rare moments of lucidity mr talks about mainstream feminism\031s historical racism when you\031re thinking he is going to right the ship he starts ranting incoherently about metoo i couldn\031t tell you what his point was there this is a faded simulacrum of the oncegreat comedian who now uses his significant platform to air grievances against the great many people he holds in contempt while deftly avoiding any accountability if we don\031t his routine the message is we are the problem not him this toxic performance crescendos when mr shares a heartbreaking story about his friend daphne dorman a comedian who died by suicide \024 suggesting that if she was fine with his comedy how dare anyone else have a problem the story is bittersweet and sometimes funny and then it is tragic and the worst part is that mr is clearly so very pleased with himself when he gets to the punchline he thinks he has won an argument when really he is exploiting the death of a friend for comedy of course we don\031t know ms dorman at all pushing back against this portrayal twists us in an impossible bind once more mr forestalls any resistance one of the strangest but most telling moments in \034the closer\035 is when mr defends dababy a rapper in the news for making pretty egregious homophobic remarks and his fellow comedian kevin hart who once lost an oscars hosting gig for making homophobic remarks both men faced professional consequences for their missteps but neither was canceled mr hart remains one of the highestpaid comedians in the world dababy has more than million monthly listeners on spotify at the end of his special mr admonishes the lgbtq community one last time imploring us to leave his \034people\035 alone if it wasn\031t clear from his words the snapshots of him with his famous pals in the closing credits of \034the closer\035 make it abundantly clear that \031s people aren\031t men or women or black people his people are wealthy celebrities and he resents

"i mostly agree with vaush\031s take on the special i think there were good parts but the criticism he laid out in the video were on point i think blaming for daphine\031s death is going too far there is no way he could have or even should have known him bringing her up in his previous special could have led to all this she could have as easily not identified herself to defend i doubt he expected her to or that the backlash she got could have helped lead to her suicide i mean the story he told of her bombing for minutes onstage and then coming back to laugh at \031s standup where she started giving it back to the crowd with the hardwood floor joke made her sound brave and tough that seems to be the way saw her maybe he had no idea she was suffering underneath it might also be true perhaps very likely true her suicide had alot more to do with other issues outside of the backlash she got online i don\031t think is malicious and i don\031t think he hates people i think the joke you highlighted at the end was a joke and nothing more i think he was sincere in saying he is done joking about the lgbt community until they are laughing with him i think he has a giant blind spot in this area where he doesn\031t understand the effects of some of the things he has said it seems to be a lack of perspective because as vaush pointed out did understand the concept of white people using his humor the laugh at black people rather than with them hopefully his last words of that special is a positive sign i do agree came across blaming the online community for her death and that was wrong",

"youre trying to tell us that one of the most popular comedians in the entire world with a platform of dozens of millions of people is ignorable people are going to fucking kill themselves because of his influence yeah those murders are tragic what about all the kids whose families are going to see the closer and become emboldened to ruin their lives get a grip this is asinine this is about the death of people and you are ignorant if you cant see that", "you have data to support any of this op youre not ignorant what about the woman that actually did die who was a supporter youre mad because he said the truth and it hurt your feelings", 
"please dont come back", "if you cant handle the internet its best to stay off of it a rule to everyone", "we can fight both issues you know it\031s sick and frustrating that the media has been so cruel to mel after his death and that they prioritize this special in their coverage because it gets more clicks the truth is that this is the first i\031ve heard of his murder it\031s probably the same for a lot of the transfem community so yeah now that i know i\031m pissed and i\031ll share and i\031ll fight all that i can for him but let\031s not act we can\031t do both", 
"i do know that and thats where my anger comes from we can fight both issues why dont we we can fight both issues why focus on the trivial compared to human life one thank you for your words about mel thats all i want is more awareness for him and all the other people being murdered alongside if not instead of the ignorant words of a transphobe", "apparently you live in a magical world where influential people with large platforms saying things has absolutely no effect on anybodys opinion at all please keep that fantasy in your head instead of using your naivete to attack people here for targeting hubs of radicalization there are innumerable people whod never heard the word terf before and now have thanks to maybe they held the views already letting them know how to easily find others and collaborate their hate is therefore bad maybe they didnt but now they can find them and given cis people probably at least partially agree with them reactionary idea dont magically stop spreading if people stop targeting the source of them half of america would still have ended up as fascists probably more than that actually had everyone ignored trump so im going to have to say t hi is again apparently to yet another person stop defending transphobes especially ones with massive platforms who introduced the concept of terfism to millions and who accused people in general of bullying each other to death your entire point that is entirely sophomoric as well real talk how many people here do you think knew precise names of murdered people anyway how many posts do you usually see i dont usually see any nor do i typically know their names never for long anyway nor do i seek out stories of things i know happened because frankly i have enough of a doomer streak in me already if i add any fuel to it there wont be a me anymore to have a doomer streak and i know thats plenty true for many here tldr youre a naive asshat and the solution to what you brought up is not defending and downplaying someone spreading a hateful ideology that justifies further violence against us with their giant mutli million dollar microphone take your own goddamn advice and join the fight stop pretending enemy recruitment is nothing edit more thoughts that came up if you want to do good lots of it by sharing stories these try not preaching the choir we already goddamn know is so harmful because he spreaded a message people didnt know go spread it to people who dont already know this shit happens its more productive than this shit youre doing what else do you expect anyone on rtraaans to do other than cry for a while and try to get their nerve back to keep fighting the same battle against this theyve been fighting spread the message to people who dont realize how much of a battle there is somehow i dont think the people being killed are those people", 
"gthalf of america would still have ended up as fascists probably more than that actually had everyone ignored trump thats exactly my point people are outraged by when in reality hes not fanning the flame or making transphobes out of otherwise normal people putting our energy into taking down his special is wasted thats trying to dam a river by putting a tent over it to stop the rain gtstop defending transphobes im not defending him at all how many times in the post do i say that yes he is a transphobe no where do i say hes not or that the things hes said arent shitty gtespecially ones with massive platforms who introduced the concept of terfism to millions millions after the jk rowling incident the terf author of a book thats x more popular than all over the world gt and who accused people in general of bullying each other to death which from what i can tell is true her name was daphne she defended him was made into the devil by her own community and killed herself six days later gtyour entire point that is entirely sophomoric as well my point about human life is pretentious and juvenile would it be if one of the people killed this year was your brother sister friend what if it was you gtreal talk how many people here do you think knew precise names of murdered people anyway how many posts do you usually see i dont usually see any nor do i typically know their names never for long anyway again that is literally my fucking point no one knows gtnor do i seek out stories of things i know happened because frankly i have enough of a doomer streak because no one gives a shit no one posts about it no one knows their names or cares to you all attack the everloving fuck out of him for fueling transphobia but when transphobia manifests in the taking of human life youd rather plug your ears and shield your eyes because of your doomer streak gtwhat else do you expect anyone on rtraaans to do i dont expect them to do anything because i didnt post there did you even read my post", 
"im here looking for who tf asked", "in black males were murdered in the usa in transgendernon binary people were murdered in the usa the news reports about topicspeople that will produce ratings period", "you wrote a fucking essay about something that you didnt watch and basing everything on a few tweets come back when you see it", "you\031re right i do need to watch it thought i\031d share my opinion up to this point i heard similar things about sticks and stones before i saw it", "the closer annoys mei didnt watch it but please read my masturbatory essay on why im bothered by it holy fuck kid are you serious you wrote all that and you havent even seen the subject the matter youre writing about as if you bring some sort of expert insight or opinion on it how fucking arrogant can you be lol im criticizing something i havent seen and im sure you guys will think that invalidate my opinion but i dont care my opinion is too important so please read my thoughts on what i am assuming about what i have no clue about youre a joke", 
"watched it and was not funny aspect made it worse same opinion yet i watched the whole thing", "deleted", "i don\031t think i\031m special thought i\031d see if anyone agreed i mean it is a related sub and we\031re talking about ", "i dont think has thrown away his morals i think you have made some assumptions about him which we simply dont know i think he needed to say a few final words probably for daphne as well those communities needed to get a big look in the mirror maybe he thrives on cancel culture but that doesnt mean he meant it that way i think this special was needed", 
"as a straight white male myself i enjoyed the whole special because i find these topics interesting i dont feel attacked at all and i rather felt a united vibe after the special we all have our problems and struggles we share that no matter race gender etc", "remember when the community bullied one of their own to death because she said hey daves a nice guy and really helped me out so take this white knight woke sjw rant and stick it karma whore", "when did this happen", "daphne dorman google is free fast and easy take the first step and learn how to educate yourself its fundamental", 
"i looked her up that\031s sad she died but i didn\031t really see anything about the community bullying her was that a theory because it did say that it did say she defended on a lot of social media posts", "i\031m not really sure why you think i\031m a karma whore if i was going for karma i would\031ve posted this to a different sub", "i fully support daves motive to uphold comedic freedom the only problem i see is not all audiences have the right mindset nor the faculties to know when it is okay to say these jokes or with the right intention thereby indirectly hurting the lgbtq movements push for progress but take note this is certainly not his intention the underlying message he wants to say imo is that comedy is a means to unite instead of divide hence the line hes going to stop making lgbtq jokes until hes sure were all laughing together eliminate the subject from the picture and youll see its the cancel culture hes trying to get at i get that youre disappointed with this special but i think youre missing the point here that he conveyed something that needs to be said this day and age not much left with the balls to do that", 
"think your confused this was his fuck yall cant cancel me i quit special it was coordinated and performed perfectly", " reacted to the reaction on his jokes no differently from the reaction he got on some of his race jokes with the difference that one community harassed a friend of his that as a consequence or jot we will never know but sure didnt help killed herself cant blame him for having what we call a venom tooth against a part of the community", "hes a boomer now plain and simple his takes are bad full of logical fallacies and he rides his own coattails from when he used to be relevant ive watched all of his specials and theyve progressively gotten less funny i dont even care about the transphobia aspect although i respect why some people feel offended his take is people are weird so let me assault you with how logical and rational i am yawn but dont let him live rent free in your brain move on and find some better standup to watch", 
"youre entitled to your opinion but before you work yourself into a conviction about it keep an open mind i think has evolved as a human being in ways that have effected his comedy but lazy i couldnt disagree more and you dont speak for anyone but yourself", "of course it\031s my opinion i do plan to watch it it\031s gonna be difficult with how floored i was with sticks and stones", "i think you\031ve got some valid observations there but you really should\031ve invested an hour prior to posting to actually watch what you\031re talking about needlessly crippling your \034essay\035 there", 
"side note i completely forgot to add the part about him claiming that only \034bored rich white people\035 are that\031s completely discounting tons of poc who may have been fans of his it\031s gross that he\031s somehow simultaneously attacking and ignoring a huge section of people with that one sentence it\031s sad that poc can\031t feel accepted in their own community because it\031s seen as something that only white people do that\031s nasty dude", "once again i think youre misrepresenting daves values based on your own subjective interpretation of his jokes only thing i didnt was his terf comment and that gender is a fact sex is but couldnt tell if he was serious or not at that part", 
"but how many of you know about the murder of mel groves royal poetical starz zoey rose martinez dont care we are dying we are getting shot and being misgendered afterwards dont care", "as a homosexual you don\031t think about how it was only a couple decades ago that someone you could have been murdered with very little concern from law enforcement or a large majority of people you may not be but your sexual predilection was all too recently considered an abomination i \031s comedy and i really the closer i think a large majority of the activists i\031ve seen in news are dorks but have a little sympathy", 
"thank you", "no sweat they made a dumb comment and i had a bit of free time to call it out", "its not dumb the vast majority of people dont care and to a large extent that is because suicides account for less than of all suicides yet the community acts as if are committing suicide per second", "respecting another humans life isn\031t a numbers game", "nah nobody is obligated they should not be forced to participate in nor support problems people and the world have much more serious matters to prioritize and solve",

"searched all those names i wouldnt have known had you not linked i admit the worker irked me because i saw the response to a few stale jokes as overblown and moving into outrage flame fawning your post realigned my perspective about what the real problems are", "thats why i wrote it people are freaking out about something really small compared to actual life", "law of the jungle is quite the calamity ain\031t it somethings never change sigh it undoubtedly continues with and without us not justifying the morality of any act i\031m pointing out the fact that true human nature is well very metal",

"your specific arguments arent great people getting murdered doesnt mean we cant also fight against smaller transphobic things making bigoted jokes about other groups of people doesnt make his transphobic jokes ok telling transphobic jokes definitely counts as spreading transphobia etc and i disagree with your support of chappelles special but im with you on the general idea that people should be more upset about actual violence against people than about a transphobic comedian i think youre barking up the wrong tree if youre getting mad at your fellow people about this though the posts in this subreddit about mel got over twice as many upvotes and comments than the biggest post about vs httpswwwredditcomrftmcommentsqbfdbitsjustajokesnowflake but the latter gets all the articles in mainstream media because thats the kind of news cis people will click and talk about complaining in spaces isnt going to do anything about that theres also a much clearer plan of action with canceling than with trying to stop murders its fairly easy to cancel and encourage others to do the same but as a lot of people mentioned in the posts about mel what are we supposed to do about murders the only real actions i saw suggested in the posts were votingwriting to representatives and donatingvolunteering for causes those are both very generic and a lot of us already do them", 
"gttrans people getting murdered doesnt mean we cant also fight against smaller transphobic things of course not my issue comes with people solely focusing on the smaller in comparison to murder transphobic things gti disagree with your support of chappelles special im not supporting it hes a transphobe and it was shitty but its besides the point gtim with you on the general idea that people should be more upset about actual violence against people than about a transphobic comedian thank you thats literally all i want i want to draw awareness to the fact that not cis people but also people are blowing this way out of proportion and trying to stop a raindrop of transphobia compared to the torrent of hate thats actually killing people how many people lobbying about it on twitter every day know about the people in the post gtbut as a lot of people mentioned in the posts about mel what are we supposed to do about murders literally acknowledge themlike comment post and tweet and rant about them as much as if not more than the words of an ignorant transphobe instead of shutting our eyes and ears because it happens", 
"gt im not supporting it hes a transphobe and it was shitty but its besides the point your original post reads you support and his actions and from your posts in other subreddits i think a lot of people are getting hung up on that if thats not the message you wanted to send you may want to edit your post for clarity gt how many people lobbying about it on twitter every day know about the people in the post i dont use twitter so ive got no idea what actually goes on over there but i dont really blame people for jumping on the issue that is easier and less emotionally exhausting to talk about has a clearer plan of action and already has a lot of traction and thus a fairly good outlook for actually getting fixed instead of an issue that has been a problem for decades and feels impossible to fight gt literally acknowledge themlike comment post and tweet and rant about them as much if not more than the words of an ignorant transphobe instead of shutting our eyes and ears because it happens making people acknowledge suffering without having anything to do to prevent it is a terrible goal when we first started seeing an increase in asian hate asiancentered spaces rasianamerican were constantly filled with articles about hate crimes and seeing that and sharing that all the time was stressful and exhausting so i had to unsubscribe for my own mental wellbeing i imagine a big reason why ive never had similar issues with spaces is because a lot of us have already learned that lesson if you can get cis people to acknowledge suffering then you might be actually getting somewhere but its hard to make cis people do that with casual transphobia so prevalent in media", 
"i\031d dare to make the argument that him bringing up terfs and platforming their ideology as misleading as he did can and will increase violence if not physically through voters and verbalemotional abuse i agree that it getting more coverage than actual murders is strange and outright wrong but platforming harmful ideology is still incredibly damaging to people it or not", "gtwhy are people putting so much energy into fighting about asking myself the same question reading this post why is this post about why does a post trying to call attention to the tragic murders of individuals need your stance on whether or not the special should be removed if every person in this sub knew of these murders the moment they happened would they be covered on fox news how much energy do you think the vast majority of the community are expending on the special i would guess less than the amount you spent on this post",
