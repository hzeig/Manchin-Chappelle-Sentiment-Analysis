"i  particularly find his special funny but i    saying   arent oppressed i   saying that  part of a community  oppressed too so  equal why do you  he misjudged his closer audience  which jokes endanger the community", " to answer the first question i  the uproar over the special speaks  clearly about how he misjudged his audience when  a comedian with his platform his audience is everyone so his failure to read the cultural room of the moment is an issue im willing to bet a  that he wasnt  to piss  off with this material when you watch the special  mostly  to defend himself against attacks on his prior material i  see malice there i see ignorance and maybe a stubborn unwillingness to admit he was wrong he does kind of acknowledge that he has had to grow with the times he uses proper pronouns throughout which is  he hasnt always done but i  despite his brushing off twitter as not a real place the criticism does  to him as for the second question the jokes themselves arent the big problem although they are generally callous and unfunny its the fact that  piling on to a community that has enough problems right now without  of the most popular comedians in the world  fun of them while he  an effort to be inclusive and treats his friend with dignity he treats the broader community poorly and that contributes to a cultural environment that puts them in danger he  call for violence but he unintentionally gives fuel to  who might do them harm", 
"ok  sense thanks", "heres the deal the ignorance  shows toward lgbtq  their rights and emotions the terf remark the bias he has against them based on limited negative interactions and the defense he uses i have a  friend are all exactly the same as black  have had to endure over the years its ironic that he  see it this way but if a white comedian stood up on stage and made a special saying i   the big deal with the n word look at how  their movement is going they are no longer slaves they accomplished more in terms of their rights than women in the last years i have a black friend that killed themselves so i support black  but blm is stupid another commenter here said im team kkk i want to  black  but i met this  black guy who robbed me and this other time i met a lazy black guy whats the deal with that are they all  that i wanted to enjoy his special ive enjoyed them over the years but maybe im getting old maybe it  me mad that he  paid millions of dollars to stand up and shit on other minorities there should be no excuse for this the worst part to me is that  knows how hard it is for minorities  been batting for black  his whole life and he  stands up and does a special shitting on other minorities", 
"i  part of it is that he feels that oppression against black americans is fundamentally worse than oppression against other minority groups you  see hints of that philosophy come through in all of his recent specials but none more so than the closer where   explicit about the idea that nobody has it worse than his group i  its  why he refuses to acknowledge that he  punch down on   as a member of the most oppressed group he  punch down because he has it worse than everybody else its a deeply flawed line of reasoning but it seems   the root of his misconceptions about the nature of his jokes and how harmful they are", 
" the oppression olympics  going on everywhere and the only  who benefit from that are oppressors", "to be generous it might  be that  been deeply involved in  fight for equality for a long time and that  him a little bit narrowly focused he never universalized his arguments", "i   probably over generous but i  your point", "no we don\031t we\031re  as sick of it as you are", "its funny how hard he plays oppression olympics when his own fanbase are  who are always complaining about how everyone wants to be oppressed nowadays", 
"these are all jokes that have been made before a  of those \034jokes\035 weren\031t even being made by comedians but by television host and news casters", "i understand which is why these following questions are very important should we subject all minorities to the same growing pains even  weve learned through the hardship of some minorities that its possible to evolve past this kind of behavior does white peoples treatment of black  throughout history make it okay for  to make these jokes at the expense of other minorities if yes at what point would it become unacceptable for black  to punch down on other minorities i suspect its  the other commenter here said  perceives black  to be the ultimate minority and therefore he believes he  punch down reality is of course more complicated we  have an ultimate minority and i truly want to live in a world where everyone is treated fairly and i believe  if not most  do", 
" its worth pointing out that the op is asking what did  do wrong and the easiest way to answer that in my opinion is to draw parallels with   have said in the past about another group that are now deemed incorrect", " he  make the distinction between mud slinging accounts on twitter nd most toxic social media and the lgtbq community in general he goes out of his way to address the entire lgbtq community explicitly in his gripes he said that they act  minorities until they  to act white around black  he based this off of  bad personal experience he said   make up words to win arguments he said the  are out to  him and he needs to look for adams apples he used a huge platform to lie about the  community he said jk rowling was cancelled for stating a biological fact first she wasnt cancelled shes  with her publisher  publishing books with crossdressing characters who are murderers if by cancelled he means that  were mean to her on twitter the biggest backlash  come out until she lied about someones contract being renewed for purposely not referring to  by their chosen pronoun to be clear not for  a mistake but going out her way to be rude to  directly jk rowling lied and said she was fired for her opinions it was so wrong and inflammatory daniel radcliff went out and made a statement about the whole  he complained that the lgbtq community is preventing him to from going after white  he said that he had them on the ropes before the lgbtq community stopped him but its  who keeps on dedicating his specials to them when his last special was released there were no articles being written about his beef with them no social media trends and then he dedicated nearly his whole special to them and if he wants to  conspiratorial about white  race and sexuality issues look at what they did in india and the philippines they did a ton to demonize homosexuality in those areas they always do  the hindymuslim animosity and the caste system in india which existed before the british came but they dialed that the knob up to by codefying into law and  it a part of their educational system and apartheid in south africa they are always pitting minority groups against each other so that they wont focus on their oppressor and i  see how this could be any more fucking glaring than that the antigay  and antitrans  are the same ones who are antiblm the same  who keep passing laws specifically targeting black  from voting he  complained that dababy  cancelled for being homophobic but not for murder first its always easier for celebrities to attack individuals over attacking minorities the ceo of papa john  cancelled for using the n word roseanne  cancelled for telling a black person she looks  a monkey kramer  cancelled for using the n word laura bush  away with running over and killing  chris brown  away with beating rihanna don king stomped a guy to death and went on to become boxings biggest promoter robert richards heir to the dupont company was convicted of raping his daughter and served no jail time attacks on individuals  elicit the media attention  racism and homophobia do but this is somehow the fault of the lgbtq community furthermore social media backlash  a strong indicator of the extent to which systemic racism and homophobia is being addressed in our society theres a  record high killings of   police   largely murder black  and face no legal repercussions actual cancellations from social media backlash are when corporations stop doing business with a person because their image no longer brings in the same revenue as when they hired them this never  challenges the root power structures and phobias in our society it  matter how  celebrities throw their careers in toilet it wont affect systemic racism in policing he complained to what extent am i obligated to participate in your self image he has none but to what extent are they obligated to indulge in the idea that he is beyond criticism to what extent should they suppress the fact that he is no longer a positive influence in their life he complained about   using made up words to win arguments but the majority of the terms that were coined for identifying phenomena regarding the marginalization of minorities came from the racial equality movements its mostly the antiblm  who criticize  for using terms  microaggressions he blamed the lgbtq community for taking away kevin harts childhood dream of hosting the oscars first off his old jokes were hurtful don lemon did a great job of explaining why im not going to link the youtube videos because that tends to  my comment deleted by the automod but ill  mention what to look up on youtube youtube don lemmon kevin hart and kevin hart later acknowledges at much saying that he has grown since youtube kevin hart apology but the issue is that he was adamant in not addressing it twice but he never apologized the first time he never apologized in every single interview he did about his hurtful comments prior to the oscars he defended himself each and every time until google the vulturecom article titled where are kevin hart\031s past apologies an investigation if hosting the oscars truly was kevins childhood dream and giving an apology and instead lying about previously apologizing was a boundary then he has a brittleass spirit daves phrase for louisck victims btw by his own usage of the terminology  tried to cancel don lemon youtube don lemmon responds to  regarding his  friends death he cited her arguments on twitter as a possible cause for her death im  going to skip over the point that twitter arguments bring the worst out of  in general and not  lgbtq  im not going to buy that story  because  said it maybe its true and maybe  else  confirm it but from the way  lied about the kevin hart and jk rowling backlash im not going to believe his story purely from his  on her situation  exclaims look how  the lgbtq movement is going as a comparison to the racial equality movement there are instances where it may be useful to compare movements to better understand varying methods of minority marginalization but this discussion is wholly incomplete without the discussion of areas where they are not comparable because systems of oppression uses different tactics to oppress different groups in chappelles own home state of ohio they passed a law that allows doctors to deny lgbtq  health care on moral grounds in states there are no explicit statewide laws at all protecting  from discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity in employment housing and public accommodations which means in over half the country you  be fired or denied housing  for being gay or  conversion therapy is legal in states texas  banned a suicide hotline for lgbtq youths i    was homophobictransphobic in his initial specials he had some cognitive biases which resulting in him saying some hurtful stuff but his refusal to accept any criticism and the resulting backlash has resulted in a full blown fear gt phobia of lgbtq  besides the good ones who are his friends its similar to a type of racism  white  have today they believe in the idea of equality in general but  the black community are  hateful to white  when the kneel for the anthem and criticize the police they use isolated incidents  looting and random youtube videos to characterize the whole black community they  the average black person has more privilege than the average white person by pointing to  being cancelled by racism the way  points to  being cancelled for homophobia they  black  are misguided in how they address systemic racism and i feel  feels similarly about how lgbtq address systemic homophobia and transphobia  wants full equality for lgbtq  but he  want them to address the very hurtful comments made by kevin hart or jk rowling he  want them to call out  for using slurs he complained about not being able to use the fword slur he  implied that the idea of the lgbtq calling themselves my  is racist but at the end of the special used that exact phrase to refer to his fellow comedians stop punching down on my  he always tries to pit the lgbtq community against the black community he complains about why is it easier for bruce jenner to change his gender than it was for cassius clay to change his name   existed in the s and throughout history it wasnt easier it took years after the stonewall riots which   referenced in his special but why do this dumb game  wants us to play does a person with cancer  to complain every time theres a breakthrough in aids research if his point is that the rich white power structures in our country are using lgbtq issues to put down black  then he should go after the white power structures in our country directly and specifically maybe there are pockets of lgbtq  putting down black   peter theil but largely the white power structures strategy is to pit marginalized grounds against each other the same   to put homophobia and transphobia into our school curriculum are the same ones who are  to prevent black  from voting  says lgbtq  act  minorities until its convenient for them not to but  is doing exactly that with his cisheteromale privilege to wage with his fellow millionaire celebrities", 
"im  and i totally agree with you and i want to continue first your third to last paragraph about jenner should probably be put in quotes i   you believe that about her but you kinda accidentally phrased it that way i had an argument with a guy as to why if i called him ugly he couldnt call me a fgtaggotlt i told him its because  what they shout at us before killing us links dude who told you the cops were on our side we witness it talk to each other but cops  necessarily put it in their reports i  agree with dababy getting away with murder being bullshit but it reminded me of al capone he did far worse  but was ultimately jailed for tax fraud hey the outcome was  the same   what we   transphobes often cite us  up words neglecting to explain how any other word forms  guy pointed rock and suddenly made up a new word",

"gtteam terf is the equivalent of a white comedian saying he supports blm and then saying they are team kkk and that race is a fact you are correct in comparing terfs to the kkk because terfs do not understand transpeople they hate natal males and wrongly spout that  are all  perverts this is harmful but more importantly it is incorrect it uses a double standard of logic lgb sexualities are okay but t sexualities are somehow perverted and invalid however in the rest of your comment theres a wild difference between being team kkk and saying race is a fact i havent seen anybody  offended over andme tests yet there  are myriad reasons to  offended over andme because geneticsrace are always presented from a eurocentric false reality but even if you  rid of the eurocentrism the genetic differences would  exist and acknowledging the existence of those differences does not make you racist now extend this logic to transpeople there are in of cases two different biological sexes transpeople wish to be the opposite sex of course a male  never truly become a female in the same way that a person of european ancestry  never become genetically japanese however if a male does wish to be female and she takes steps to emulate women visually and culturally then i  that society owes it to her to not socially degrade her the race equivalent of this would be a poc assimilating to european culture and  not being socially degraded however acknowledging the difference between an african person and a european in a respectful way is not racism and the transequivalent would  not be transphobia", 
"thank you for your response and it seems for the most part we agree race is a fact i guess couldve been worded differently but i would  to note race is a social construct in fact academia  use the term race and instead use clines since its a gradient rather than a cut and dry  i guess a better equivalent would be saying   eugenics is a fact or some other form of scientific racism as an aside transracialism is an interesting debate but since there  any data on individuals having racial dysphoria to even a fraction of a percentage  individuals experience gender dysphoria again gender not sex they identify as a different gender at this time its kinda a moot point", 
"its  worth mentioning that sex is a far far more fundamental division than race there are millions of different races most of them now extinct or mixed and the ones that exist today are simply mixes of the old ones race is multidimensional sex is largely a dichotomy you  be north or southeast asian indian african european north african american native etc et al but for sex you are only male or female for of cases race  blend sex  parents of different races form a genetic intermediate between them parents of different sexes formeither sons or daughters for this reason i  support having transgender athletes in womens competitions but i do support bathroom choice and usage of appropriate himher pronouns the multidimensional ximxer pronouns are  silly it would be  me insisting that everyone remember every weird quirk and hobby that i have", 
"i mean  only because  how we socially constructed it now that its widely known there are far more than two sexes intersex turner syndrome etc and  again noting that gender is different than sex and is  a spectrum whose to say we  see blendings of sex we  have quite a bit of evidence that  athletes arent a problem httpswwwncbinlmnihgovpmcarticlespmc gtgtmetaanalysis covering prior research on  individuals\031 performance in sports and preexisting sports policies concerning   gtgtfindings show there is no consistent or direct research indicating transgender women have an unfair athletic advantage at any stage of their transition gtgtadditional findings show most sports policies are not evidencebased and  individuals experience substantial discrimination from sports institutions neopronouns to me are  a nickname theres no negative to me calling  ximxer and theres only positives from the other person so i   see an issue", 
"it\031s very telling that a major part of his special and the reason for the special existing was due to a  friend in the industry who killed herself weeks after defending him in public and getting a ton of hate from her own community i\031m   is laughing at the hypocrisy and the irony right now because those who needed to make that connection and see it are now seeing it and those who are screaming about him and  to  him cancelled are proving the point he was  to make and none of this outrage has called attention to his dead  friend despite being a unique and special opportunity to give all this press towards  awareness",

"gtand  he  say it she was brutally criticized and harassed by other   and allies for defending chapelles last special shortly before committing suicide he does say it  they dragged that bitch on twitter for days and she held her own cause she funny interestingly enough there is literally zero evidence of this go look through her twitter account from the time she made the tweet defending him to the days after leading to her death not a single ", "daphnes sister has  said that criticism against her had nothing to do with her death and it was her personal struggles with ptsd httpstwittercomchristianeveestatustacekubfpobndifnqqamps",

"wow  this is  a  good point", "but  not why he walked away from all that he hated to see his comedy be so commoditized that it was robbed of its actual meaning and point and then to become such an authority on all he  his shows about that literally he cannot make a joke about  in a manner he uses as material anyways plus to see his own material used to exploit his own  contribute to another system of pure exploitation incidentally contribute to the hollywood system by continuing to work in it etc a finer point that i heard him mention on in the actors studio was that he  feel good about the comedy that he was  as it wasnt facilitating truth and reconciliation between   further defining the other and reinforcing the same issues he was pointing out if you listen to his material in its context you would know to not  his material at face value it serves to showcase an exaggerated viewpoint to see the hypocrisy of being sensitive while not observing or understanding subtly because everything is so exaggerated lately that no   say  publicly without it getting exaggerated personally i   doing the same  again drawing the public eye to a problem the only way he knows how  jokes and material that is potentially more genuine and thought provoking and showcasing the subtlety required to discuss such  in public everything gets exaggerated  which stops productive discussion in its tracks because subtle differences is kinda what defines everyone and is therefore universal calling out identity politics on the way of course because no  is only   but everyone is human and has struggles those struggles are  different for everyone i  see him being genuinely understood for a while not while our global culture  universally understand nuance", 
"perhaps his old comedy did that but youve seen the actual material in his new special there is no subtly or nuance   directly complaining that  being criticized and then doubled down by calling himself a terf and repeating the same talking points that antitrans folks use against the community but i  that  desperately want to hold comedians to this standard of modern public intellectuals where every joke is some rich and thoughtful critique on modern society when in reality    to make  laugh while sometimes using the stage as their own therapist couch", 
"this was a big issue i had with later sets of lewis black his early stuff was brilliant and insightful but then i saw him live towards the end of his career and despite me being a huge fan that i drove hours to see him i could only summarize his set as old  yells at clouds even without the  stuff his sets are mediocre at best now there is no real point or message  an old man complaining about the way times have changed toss him up there with jerry seinfeld and mike meyers complaining that   find tired ass jokes from years ago funny anymore", 
"id agree with you that  dispensed with the subtlety but if you  hear the specific distinctions he says in his new stuff all of it and understand the absolutely non broad stroke references he  theres far more nuance than you seem to observe specifically distinguishing between movements and   you final point works with some comedians but not with  id even argue  never used comedy  a public therapy session  watch his show it was always about societal observations", "gthe saw first hand that jokes   be harmful even if that wasnt the intent yet is now blind to that because its  that  directly affect him you gtbut  not why he walked away from all that  you gtplus to see his own material used to exploit his own  do you see the contradiction do you see why  wrong and  ranting aimlessly to hear yourself self congratulate over thinking you understand nuance you   that  disagree with  so you  start talking completely blind to the fact that you  agree with that persons point you immediately shot down", 
"this is the nuance that i was talking about its not a contradiction because as his jokes  commercialized they turned into  else he mostly left because he saw that he was simply contributing to the hollywood system of artist exploration and saw the damage it was doing to himself and while away he saw that he couldnt control and make money off of his own stuff and his jokes werent landing the way he wanted as a result there were  reasons he left some which might sound contradictory if taken out of context so maybe you should watch the source material i cited before doing exactly that inside the actors studio a brushing  evolve and  master after its evolution there was a reason i posted there and not above since you  seem to  the intent of replies while i was agreeing with him the main reason he left is what i started above and it wasnt a simple  nor the  the original reply meant i  mind that  disagree with him i  agree with him on some  myself but when its obvious that most arent taking the time to understand the points he  and  his stuff out of context it  ironically proved his point  you did for me there", 
"when he laughed it made me uncomfortable says  as a matter of fact that was the last  i shot before i told myself i gotta  f time out after this because my head almost exploded that was when he left he took time off did an interview with time and at that point he was unsure if he was coming  but the reason he needed time off was because of his feeling that his jokes were having a harmful effect and he  want those skits released their violation of that is  a contributing factor in why he chose to not return but again it stemmed from the skits and that laughter giving him that feeling i understand his points i understand why the laughter  subtly be the difference between the racist pixie being seen as ones persistent inner conscience   to deny rather than the personification of racism and its effect on internal thoughts causing a weird sort of guilt he fails to appreciate that when its not his group", 
"eh two entirely different   not advocating to cancel others because  offended as far as i  remember he has never done that besides asking fans to not watch  show under hbo which is  different because its a personal grudge not a this company said  offensive so boycott them his quitting the show was his personal feeling that he   how some  were reacting to his material he felt uncomfortable and so he quit his job that is in no way saying that comedians should be cancelled for a subjectively bad joke", 
"and this is getting downvoted wow", "because its a silly distinction it is not two entirely different  the effect is the same", "its not the effect that he said is different the reason edit btw i  daves jokes were not that great in this special it was way too personal for him and it visibly hurt him to be labeled as hateful by so   and i  dig the  comedian friend but being dragged into this either although i understand that he wanted to put the story in the spotlight the way he did it is suboptimal at best although i do agree that  are being beought into this world by women and are fathered by men   call themselves  they want feel themselves to be whatever they want but  force others to change terminology and bend language to your ideas in my opinion", 
"the world must be much simpler in black and white if you  see the difference between quitting because  upset vs being fired because  else is upset theres no point in talking", "gt if you  see the difference between quitting because  upset vs being fired because  else is upset theres no point in talking he cancelled the show and all the associated workers because he was offended by how  else was laughing at him not with him he  want to be cancelled because other  are offended because he is laughing at them not with him you are definitely correct about no point in talking ",

" if you  want to create arguments that i never made and tell me why they\031re wrong who am i to stop you", "no  quit the  show because he was allowed to sit there and dog on the black community but he wasnt allowed full artistic control he left millions on the table amp walked away", "gtthought the special kinda sucked i   but bitching about  activists being rude on twitter while  saying he had a  friend  seems sanctimonious bill burr said about hypocrites and hecklers its funny until joke is about you or  you care about  remember exact words but it was   that", 
"repeating the same talking points from a decade ago  funny in any context", "you must be fun police if you decide whats funny and whats not besides what talking points", "humor typically comes from presenting the unexpected presenting the same jokes that have been made over the last decade  funny so much as triggering a memory of  that was funny its nostalgia not humor as for the talking points its  standard  arent women only genders  are fake oppressed", "if  how you look at it then we  joke at all because everybody already made joke about every single topic so lets send them to gulag i guess comedy is not only about unexpected but  delivery etc unexpected without delivery  humor its  surprise there is a reason why edgy jokes are usually good when said by comedians but  be extremely offensive when said by average joe", 
" it wasnt very good its unfortunate since i recall thinking his first  special of this series was downright hilarious i    a funny and insightful guy but he went a bit too hard down this road i feel  he could have addressed it in  special and he could have been done with it but he kept going", "gt i   but bitching about  activists being rude on twitter while  saying he had a  friend  seems sanctimonious  you explain why seems  it\031s rational to have a  friend but  dislike rude   on twitter or is it kinda  if you say  negative about any   then you\031re outta the liberal club kinda seems  that\031s what it is",

"lol im not pretending to say  gti could suggest that he isn\031t using his friendship with a  person as justification for his criticism he literally says in the special that he  be transphobic because he had a  friend how is that any different than me saying  racist and then sayin i  be racist my friend is x", " would probably be super upset by a white comic  racial black jokes and then ending the special by talking about how he was bffs with a black person so he  be racist", "i  remember him ever saying i  be transphobic because i obviously  have the special memorized  so im giving you the benefit of the doubt and asking for the direct quote edit am i supposed to  the silence and downvotes as proof that he did not in fact literally say that",

community explicitly he said that they act  minorities until they  to act white around black  he based this off of  bad experience he had with them he joked how he had to look out for   he said   make up words to win arguments he used a huge platform to lie about the  community is punching down in his last special he said jk rowling was cancelled for stating a biological fact first she wasnt cancelled shes  with her publisher  publishing books with  characters who are murderers if by cancelled he means that  were mean to her on twitter the biggest controversy  come out until she lied about someones contract being renewed for purposely not referring to  by their chosen pronoun not  a mistake but going out her way to be rude to  she interacts with jk rowling said she was fired for her opinions twitter uses have characters  has a longform format on  of the biggest platforms on the world and  using it to lie about the lgbtq community  what punching down means but to  punching down on him is critiquing his demand to use a homophobic slur the f word  he never  cancelled for    not go on twitter if he  want to hear about the  he  upset but  not good enough for him he complained that the lgbtq community is preventing him to from going white  that he had them on the ropes before the lgbtq community its  who keeps on dedicating his specials to them when his last special was released there were no articles being written about his beef with them no social media trends and then he dedicated nearly his whole special to them and if he wants to  conspiratorial about white  race and sexuality issues look at what they did in india and the philippines they did a ton to demonize homosexuality in those areas they always do  the caste system in india and apartheid in south africa they are always pitting minority groups against each other so that they wont focus on their oppressor and i  see how this could be any more fucking glaring that the antigay  and antitrans  are the same ones who are antiblm he  complained that dababy  cancelled for being homophobic but not for murder first its always easy for celebraties for attacking minorities than for attacking individuals the ceo of papa john  cancelled for using the n word roseanne  cancelled for telling a black person she looks  a monkey barbara bush  away with running over  chris brown  away with beating rihanna but most of this is out of the hands of the lgbtq community futhermore social media backlash  a strong indicator of the extent to which systemic racism and homophobia is being addressed in our society theres a  record high killings of   police and  largely murder black  and face no legal repercussions he complained to what extent am i obligated to participate in your self image you have none  but to what extent are they obligated to indulge in the idea that you are beyond criticism he complained about   using made up words to win arguments when it was terfs who coined that term specifically to identify themselves as those who exclude   from their efforts  the majority of the terms that were coined for identifying phenomena regarding the marginalization of minorities came from the racial equality movement its mostly the antiblm  who criticize  for using terms  microaggressions he blamed the lgbtq community for taking away kevin harts childhood dream of hosting the oscars first off his old jokes were hurtful don lemon did a great job of explaining why httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvmbnyddpkcbo httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvccdtefwhny and kevin hart later acknowledges at much saying that he has grown since httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvqwgrfwwi but the issue is that he was adamant in not addressing it twice but he never apologized the first time every interview he did about it he defended himself httpswwwvulturecomkevinharthomophobictweetsapologiesellendegenereshtml btw by his own usage of the terminology  tried to cancel don lemon httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvobinyneyo i    was homophobictransphobic in his initial specials he had some cognitive biases which resulting in him saying some hurtful stuff but his refusal to accept any criticism and the resulting backlash has resulted in a full blown fear gt phobia of lgbtq  besides the good ones who are his friends its similar to a type of racism  white  have today they believe in the idea of equality in general but  the black community are  hateful to white  when the kneel for the anthem and criticize the police they  black  are misguided in how they address systemic racism and i feel  feels similarly about how lgbtq address systemic homophobia and transphobia  specifically made comments about the sufferings of   about unjust bathrooms laws so its hard to talk about this on the only major medium  have to discuss this twitter characters most of the responses are you  watch the special  wants full equality for lgbtq  but he  want them to address the very hurtful jokes made by kevin hart or the comments by jk rowling he  want them to call out  for using sluts he complained about not being able to use the fword slur he  implied that the idea of the lgbtq calling themselves my  is racist but at the end of the special used that exact phrase to refer to his fellow comedians stop punching down on my  he always tries to pit the lgbtq community against the black

sometimes bad   make good art comedians in particular are going to punch up and down and sidetoside  true comedy is not above criticism even if the most famous wildly wealthy comedians will keep insulting those who question them it\031s  laughs right lighten up all criticism is forestalled with this setup in which when you object to  a comedian says you\031re the problem you\031re the  who\031s narrowminded or \034brittle\035 or humorless \034shut up\035   recalls telling a woman who had the gall to challenge his comedy using a sexist slur and laughing at how witty he is as if he\031s the first man to ever deliver such an original funny line \034before i kill you and put you in the trunk ain\031t nobody around here\035 the audience cheers before mr  explains that he didn\031t in fact threaten the woman \034i felt that way but that\031s not what i said i was more clever than that\035 mr  spends much of \034the closer\035 his latest comedy special for  cleverly deflecting criticism the set is a minute display of the comedian\031s own brittleness the selfproclaimed \034goat\035 greatest of all time of standup delivers five or six lucid moments of brilliance surrounded by a joyless tirade of incoherent and seething rage misogyny homophobia and transphobia if there is brilliance in \034the closer\035 it\031s that mr   obvious but elegant rhetorical moves that frame any objections to his work as unreasonable he\031s  being \034brutally honest\035 he\031s  saying the quiet part out loud he\031s  stating \034facts\035 he\031s   us  but when an entire comedy set is designed as a series of strategic moves to say whatever you want and insulate yourself from valid criticism i\031m not  you\031re   comedy throughout the special mr  is singularly fixated on the lgbtq community as he has been in recent years he reaches for every lowhanging piece of fruit and munches on it gratuitously  of mr \031s rants are extraordinarily dated the kind of comedy you might expect from a conservative boomer agog at the idea of homosexuality at times his voice lowers to a hoarse whisper preparing us for a grand stroke of wisdom \024 but it never comes every once in a while he remarks that oh boy he\031s in trouble now  a mischievous little boy who  \031t help himself somewhere buried in the nonsense is an interesting and accurate observation about the white gay community conveniently being able to claim whiteness at will there\031s a compelling observation about the relatively significant progress the lgbtq community has made while progress toward racial equity has been much slower but in these formulations there are no gay black  mr  pits  from different marginalized groups against  another callously suggesting that   are performing the gender equivalent of blackface in the next breath mr  says  about how a black gay person would never exhibit the behaviors to which he objects an assertion  would dispute the poet saeed jones for example wrote in gq that watching \034the closer\035 felt  a betrayal \034i felt  i\031d  been stabbed by  i once admired and now he was demanding that i stop bleeding\035 later in the show mr  offers rambling thoughts on feminism using a webster\031s dictionary definition further exemplifying how limited his reading is he  a tired tired joke about how he thought \034feminist\035 meant \034frumpy dyke\035 \024 and hey i  it if i were on his radar he would consider me a frumpy dyke or worse some may consider that estimation accurate fortunately my wife doesn\031t then in another of those rare moments of lucidity mr  talks about mainstream feminism\031s historical racism  when you\031re thinking he is going to right the ship he starts ranting incoherently about metoo i couldn\031t tell you what his point was there this is a faded simulacrum of the oncegreat comedian who now uses his significant platform to air grievances against the great   he holds in contempt while deftly avoiding any accountability if we don\031t  his routine the message is we are the problem not him this toxic performance crescendos when mr  shares a heartbreaking story about his  friend daphne dorman a comedian who died by suicide \024 suggesting that if she was fine with his comedy how dare anyone else have a problem the story is bittersweet and sometimes funny and then it is tragic and the worst part is that mr  is clearly so very pleased with himself when he gets to the punchline he thinks he has won an argument when  he is exploiting the death of a friend for comedy of course we don\031t know ms dorman at all pushing  against this portrayal twists us in an impossible bind once more mr  forestalls any resistance  of the strangest but most telling moments in \034the closer\035 is when mr  defends dababy a rapper in the news for   egregious homophobic remarks and his fellow comedian kevin hart who once lost an oscars hosting gig for  homophobic remarks both men faced professional consequences for their missteps but neither was canceled mr hart remains  of the highestpaid comedians in the world dababy has more than million monthly listeners on spotify at the end of his special mr  admonishes the lgbtq community  last time imploring us to leave his \034\035 alone if it wasn\031t clear from his words the snapshots of him with his famous pals in the closing credits of \034the closer\035 make it abundantly clear that  \031s  aren\031t men or women or black  his  are wealthy celebrities and he resents even the possibility of them facing consequences for their actions",
