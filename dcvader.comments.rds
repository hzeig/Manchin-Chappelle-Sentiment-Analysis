I don't often give credit to leftists but to explain the difference - a meeting of those groups is clear, concise, they know what they want, what priorities to take, what path moving forward, necessary gatekeeping etc - and even post revolution steps - as baffling as it seems communist revolutions actually do a lot better in the first few years (just after a long civil war and such) then they do many years on...

Compare this to an id-pol leftist group where the first hour of the meeting is spent outlining triggers and grievances because Tyrone called Emily (bun/bunself) ""she"" last week but the resolution must be agreed by both the BIPOC and the LGBTQ2SQIA+ community...

...not even the politicos know what the fuck they want and what their priorities are (there was a DSA meeting filmed where for 20 minutes they wanted the police defunded because ACAB and BLM...100% voted aye on this being a measure they should take steps towards should the DSA in the city get power next election...the next agenda was increasing the police budget and more boots on the ground to prevent violence against the LGBTQ+ and women...100% voted aye on that motion too...two COMPLETELY contradictory votes within the same meeting and not one person pointed this out and the numbers had 0 correlation (If it was 50% on both votes you could assume principled members voted aye/nay to defund and then the opposite of that to increase funds next vote)...

...their priorities are absolutely non existent because the progressive stack is an absolute nightmare to operate within - is their priority the working poor, trans liberation, BIPOC uplifting, feminist liberation, rural development - depends on what went viral first that day...remember CHAZ - id-pol leftists had a literal fucking warlord shaking down business owners and shooting ""counter-revolutionaries"" - while they were ""busy"" creating a racially segregated ""garden"" where certain veg and fruit was for ""BIPOC only""...say what you will about traditional Marxists but Soviets weren't exactly asking their POW's about their preferred pronouns...",-0.952,0.056,0.861,0.083

Dave had a great point in ""The Closer"".  To paraphrase, the Trans community got more acknowledgement and has gotten more special treatment and accommodation than the black community EVER has.  They got companies to cater to them, got representation in media and entertainment, got to openly speak out in companies.  They didn't have a ""Trans Civil Rights"" era where they had to legit fight and struggle and scratch and claw to make things happen.  They just got handed shit.  On a silver fucking platter.  Instead of recognizing that they've gotten some incredible things handed to them with little to no fight and mostly all tantrum throwing, they instead scream that they demand and deserve more.    

I'll happily stand up for a trans person and say they should have representation, and rights, and ability to do things.  Absolutely.  We're a diverse species and I'm fine with inclusion and diversity being represented.  But I'll be damned if they are able to stand on the necks of the Black, Asian, Indian, Hispanic/Latino and even GAY communities and say shit like ""We've struggled and have been oppressed"".  Most of the trans people screaming and making these demands have never faced a struggle or oppression a day in their life.  Most of the oppression or struggle they feel they face is completely in their own heads.

The whole community making these demands are the equivalent of a spoiled child being invited to the dinner table with others.  There are people who have been at the table far longer then they have.  Some who were basically given the table, born with their place already intact.  Some who had to struggle and work hard to get there, but when they did, they were more than happy to share their food with others and were just happy to be included.  Then there are some who have had to struggle, scratch, claw, bleed, and face real loss and hardship to get to that seat.  Just to be offered a corner of a chair to even sit down like equals with the rest.  Those folks who face persecution and death for something as small and uncontrollable as the color of their skin they were born with.  But god damn it, they have a seat at the fucking table.  And they're grateful for that spot.  Even others are able to see that those people who just got that seat are needing more.  Their plates are almost empty.  Having nothing but scraps.  They need more.  But nobody can raise that topic in the conversation.

Why?  Because the 20 something guy who wants to be a woman was just given a chair at the table.  All they did was yell and scream and complain on twitter.  And just like that, they got a seat at the table.  To make things worse, that 20 something year old was given a plate of all of the delicious food brought by the lovely gay couple from up the road who found time to make a delicious assortment of foods while taking care of their newly adopted baby from China, who weren't given 2 months of paid time off.  They've had to work hard and deal with some weird looks, but son of a bitch, they're at that table and brought a lovely arrangement.  But then the trans 20 something year old guy who wants to be a woman brings the night to a screeching halt.  Why?  Because instead of looking at all they've been offered with little to no effort, instead of being appreciative of the fact they're even at the table...  They're now banging on the table and calling everyone at the table a racist, sexist, transphobe because they haven't been given their dessert yet, and the DESERVE their dessert.

I was in high school when Massachusetts legalized gay marriage kind of out of nowhere, and I remember thinking,  yeah, so what if two men or two women want to get married? I was part of the gay marriage push in a small way, and that was the big LGBT issue all throughout my 20s. My opinion on same sex couples hadnt changed and I consider it a victory that SCOTUS gave them their right to get married. Todays SCOTUS probably wouldnt have. 

So maybe its that Im old now and the trans thing is new and kind of beyond me& but I dont think so. Im not THAT old, but I look at trans activists, how they screech about their oppression while having the power to turn the world against figures like JK Rowling or Margaret Atwood, I see how they theorize that straight men and lesbians should be instantly okay sucking a dick if the person says they are a woman& how a rape victim in Virginia was told it never happened because to #BelieveWomen in that moment might go against a trans-friendly bathroom policy& and just the general way in which they want everyone to accommodate their confusion in how we use language and otherwise comport ourselves&

Nearly every A list comedian has at least one public wtf moment. Remember when Michael Richards (Kramer from Seinfeld) started dropping racial slurs? That wasn't part of his act, but Louis CK made pedophile jokes on SNL, and that was scripted. Joan Rivers made holocaust jokes at the Oscars.

This is Dave Chappelle having his moment. Or maybe his 2nd/3rd moment, since his Comedy Central show was controversial. I'm sure that Chappelle's intent is to make people laugh while getting them to consider the world around them.

I think people are projecting their own opinions on Dave. Some want him to be an effigy for all the transphobes of the world. He's invited that by identifying himself as a TERF. Others see defending him as a way to fight ""counter culture"" and normalize their own transphobia.

I suspect most people wish he hadn't said anything controversial at all so that they dont need to have conflicted feelings about him. A lot of folks have had to consider whether it's ok to listen to Michael Jackson or to watch a Kevin Spacey movie over the past couple years. Now they're being asked to reconsider a comedian that they've been following for decades. These folks are going to have their own irrational thoughts.

a black man &amp; white man are not distinctly different biologically, you can embrace &amp; have an affinity for a different culture w/o a need for a transition, hence no ""trans-race""",0.864,0.124,0.83,0.046
"That makes sense but once you get into the weeds you're gonna run into a whole bunch of issues.

For one, it's been made clear to me that you don't have to physically transition to be trans, so a biological man can declare himself a woman, present themselves that way (or not) and they're just as much a woman as someone born that way.

He did not say that is what he believed. Personally, I don't think he fully comprehends why saying ""I'm team TERF"" can be so damaging. He didn't even realize he was a feminist until he looked up the definition after his last special. But you can't subscribe to the ideaology of TERFs and be friends with a trans individual, just like you can't be an active KKK member, and be friends with a black individual.

He deserved to be called out on that, but we need to get the context right when doing so.

I also think he confuses, or, doesn't make the distinction between sex and gender, which is required when speaking on trans issues.

That's also what trans people want. The difference is you don't view their version of ""stop treating them like shit"" as valid. Using proper pronouns and the like is what not treating them like shit looks like.

People in the past would say the same thing about black people- that they want a complete overhaul of the way we look at language (for things like slurs), or ignoring biology/history, etc.

&gt;I am not willing to pretend that Caitlyn Jenner was never named Bruce.

You don't need to pretend that, though. You can simply avoid calling her Bruce unless it's necessary. 

Sometimes, that's unavoidable, if you're talking about the past. Many times, however, it is, and doing it anyway egregiously is pretty clearly a sign of not accepting the new identity.

For instance, in your Republican example, it would be like referring to Bob Dole as a Republican in present tense conversations. There is no reason to do that. Especially since 'transwoman' already conveys the same information. That's what the trans part is for.",-0.632,0.107,0.781,0.112

I'm sorry, but it is just not treating someone like shit to acknowledge basic truths, like ""Caitlyn used to be named Bruce"" or ""Much of a woman's experience is defined by the experience of growing up a girl"" or ""There are clear biological differences between trans women and cis women"" or ""It is unreasonable to expect cisgender lesbians to consider you part of their dating pool after transitioning.""

You know what I had to do when my college roommate came out as gay? Nothing. Not one thing.

When my bass player came out as trans, every single thing I said from then out was being scrutinized. Is this the ""proper"" way to perceive gender? Will it make her dysphoric to ask her to carry her own amp? If I say ""guys,"" is it an act of malice? Which ways of telling stories about our past friendship will trigger her?

Many scientists try to believe that most animals lack, at least, a complex culture; therefore, they cannot have gender. However this has been shown to be increasingly false especially in more intelligent mammals like great apes, dolphins and whales. Mammals that live groups tend to be ruled by more complex structures and thus are more likely to have some form of gender roles  (my opinion).

"It's complicated. He doesn't (and has never) said trans people are bad, or that they don't deserve human rights. The problem is that he refuses to acknowledge that their oppression is valid, or that they are, in fact, a vulnerable community that faces violence due to things that are beyond their control.

In comic's parlance, this is a concept known as ""punching down"". This is a rule in comedy that says that making jokes about someone weaker than you is a bad idea, because the audience won't feel comfortable laughing about rape victims or the homeless. It's just mean-spirited and cruel to make light of the circumstances of somebody worse off than you. It's why so many comedians like to make jokes about politicians, because politicians are powerful. You can never punch down at somebody who controls the nuclear codes.

Chappelle tries to make the argument that he isn't punching down in the special, because he personally sees trans people as equals worthy of the same rights as himself. While that is a noble sentiment, it's ultimately misplaced. The comic making the joke doesn't get to decide through their own enlightenment who is and is not an oppressed community. The audience decides, and he gravely misjudged his audience in The Closer. I think it was more due to arrogance on his part than malice, but the fact remains that he fucked up big time.

The jokes he makes aren't insightful or particularly funny, they're just mean, and they feed into a larger transphobic narrative that humiliates, and ultimately endangers, that community.

"I guess I wouldn't say it's an ironclad law of comedy, but it's a very useful guideline. A comic's job is to make people laugh, not to make them uncomfortable or angry, so the rule about punching down is about making sure it stays entertaining for them. Comedy is about the audience, not the comedian.

Some comics skirt that rule using various tricks. Norm MacDonald was certainly very dark, but he was careful to pick his targets well. He was famous for going after OJ Simpson, a celebrity millionaire, for example. That wasn't punching down. Also, when he did toe the line, he did so with a kind of sly wink to the audience, to let them know he knew he was pushing the envelope. He was a very cerebral type of comedian, and he knew full well what he was doing, and he made sure the audience knew it too.

I'm not familiar with that particular Kinison bit, I never was a huge fan of his, but he was well known as a guy who was willing to go over the line of good taste to try to get a laugh. Most comics nowadays that walk the edge, like Chappelle, generally are very good at going right up to the line and not crossing it. Chappelle, unfortunately, crossed over this time, and this reaction is the natural result of that.

There are some comics that disdain the very idea of punching down, but usually I find them to be out of touch. Some comedians get so far up their own ass that they blame the audience when they cross a line and get a bad reaction (Exhibit A: Bill Maher). One thing I learned from a veteran comic when I was doing stand-up is that the audience is never wrong. If they don't laugh, that's on you, and you need to adjust your material to compensate or read the room better. Some famous comedians, especially ones who have done it for a long time, get to a point where they feel entitled to laughs, and that's IMO a fundamental misunderstanding of the art of comedy. If they don't find you funny, you're probably the problem. That's my two cents, anyway.",0.988,0.184,0.711,0.105
"Thanks for this.

I'm not coming from it to defend or advocate anything either, but trying to be as objective as I can as a comedy fan. That said, I also disagree that comics job is ""not to  make people uncomfortable."" Part of the comedic space is to play with things that we can't usually get away with in ordinary discourse. And at times, it's inevitable that a comic may go in directions that make *us* uncomfortable, not just *those* (bad) *guys.* As you note well, it's often messy and/or inapt.

Comics like to provoke, esp. what they see as ""piety mongering"".

Norm himself had some Caitlin Jenner jokes as well as one that gently made fun of certain trans-rights claims. I doubt he was transphobic, but his ""punching upwards"" was to criticize the easy moralisms of the entertainment industry--notice his passionate defense of Shane Gillis against the twitter mob.

And if the audience is never wrong, then Chapelle's bit would be ok, right? Since it is a only a vocal minority that didn't like it.

Not every comedian needs to make you think, but every comedian needs to make you laugh. Otherwise, you're just monologuing up there. That's not stand-up, it's making a speech. I think that's an important distinction. I think it's a misconception people have that comedy needs to challenge your expectations or push your boundaries. Plenty of comics manage to be funny and successful without pushing buttons. Patton Oswalt has never been particularly controversial, but I think he's hilarious, and his career has gone really well despite never feeling the need to be edgy.

Now, that being said, being transgressive with your humor IS an effective way to get laughs. It's why so many comics do it. There are various ways to get away with pushing the boundaries of good taste, but in order to push the limits, there have to BE limits. If everything is acceptable to joke about, nothing about controversial comedy would be ""controversial"". It's those cultural taboos that ultimately make that style of comedy successful because they give the comic something to approach, but not directly challenge.

Comedy is in a lot of ways about breaking rules. Laughter comes from the unexpected and absurd, after all. Comics that find clever ways to break the rules enjoy well-deserved success. I'm always impressed by how Daniel Tosh and Anthony Jeselnik manage to get away with taboo humor just by being clever about their onstage personas. But I think there are, and have to be, limits. If not hard ones that cannot be broken, soft ones that can be bent.",0.998,0.29,0.675,0.035

I agree entirely with this and what you said overall. It's why certain politically-minded comics pretty much just pander. I honestly think DC and Norm and others see themselves as pushing back at a certain fashionable piety (of the academic/entertainment left) which is the opposite of pandering, much as Patrice (RIP) did with certain pieties of feminism.

But it can veer into things that a sensitive person would balk at, as you rightly note.

"I didn't particularly find his special funny but I don't think he's saying trans people aren't oppressed. I think he's saying that he's part of a community that's oppressed too so they're equal.

"Well, to answer the first question, I think the uproar over the special speaks pretty clearly about how he misjudged his audience. When you're a comedian with his platform, his audience is ""everyone"", so his failure to read the cultural ""room"" of the moment is an issue.

I'm willing to bet a lot that he wasn't trying to piss people off with this material. When you watch the special, he's mostly trying to defend himself against attacks on his prior material. I don't see malice there, I see ignorance, and maybe a stubborn unwillingness to admit he was wrong. He does kind of acknowledge that he has had to grow with the times (he uses proper pronouns throughout, which is something he hasn't always done), but I think despite his brushing off Twitter as ""not a real place"", the criticism does get to him.

As for the second question, the jokes themselves aren't the big problem (although they are generally callous and unfunny). It's the fact that they're piling on to a community that has enough problems right now without one of the most popular comedians in the world making fun of them. While he makes an effort to be inclusive and treats his friend with dignity, he treats the broader community poorly, and that contributes to a cultural environment that puts them in danger.

"Here's the deal: the ignorance Chappelle shows toward LGBTQ people (their rights and emotions - the ""TERF"" remark), the bias he has against them based on limited (negative) interactions, and the defense he uses (""I have a trans friend"") are *all* exactly the same as black people have had to endure over the years. 

It's ironic that he doesn't see it this way, but if a white comedian stood up on stage and made a special saying:

* ""I don't get the big deal with the 'N word' - look at how well their movement is going! They are no longer slaves! They accomplished more in terms of their rights than women in the last 150 years!""

* ""I have a black friend that killed themselves. So I support black people! But BLM is stupid. (another commenter here said: ""I'm team KKK!"")""

* ""I want to like black people but I met this one black guy who robbed me! And this other time I met a lazy black guy! What's the deal with that, are they all like that?!""

I wanted to enjoy his special. I've enjoyed them over the years. But maybe I'm getting old, maybe it makes me mad that he got paid millions of dollars to stand up and shit on other minorities... there should be no excuse for this.

I think it's also why he refuses to acknowledge that he can punch down on trans people. As a member of the ""most oppressed"" group, he can't punch down because he has it worse than everybody else.

He didn't make the distinction between mud slinging accounts on twitter (2nd most toxic social media) and the LGTBQ community in general. He goes out of his way to address the entire LGBTQ community explicitly in his gripes. He said that they act like minorities until they need to act white around Black people. He based this off of one bad personal experience. He said 'Trans people make up words to win arguments'. He said the trans are out to get him and he needs to look for adams apples

----

He used a huge platform to lie about the trans community. He said JK Rowling was cancelled for stating a biological fact. First, she wasn't cancelled. she's still with her publisher, still publishing books with cross-dressing characters who are murderers

If by cancelled he means that people were mean to her on twitter, the biggest backlash didn't come out until she lied about someone's contract being renewed for purposely not referring to people by their chosen pronoun. To be clear, not for making a mistake, but going out her way to be rude to people directly. JK Rowling lied and said she was fired for her opinions. It was so wrong and inflammatory Daniel Radcliff went out and made a statement about the whole thing.

----

He complained that the LGBTQ community is preventing him to from going after white people. He said that he had them on the ropes before the LGBTQ community stopped him. But it's Dave who keeps on dedicating his specials to them. When his last special was released there were no articles being written about his beef with them, no social media trends. And then he dedicated nearly his whole special to them

And if he wants to get conspiratorial about white people, race, and sexuality issues, look at what they did in India and the Philippines. They did a ton to demonize homosexuality in those areas. They always do. Like the Hindy/Muslim animosity and the Caste system in India (which existed before the British came, but they dialed that the knob up to 100% by codefying into law and making it a part of their educational system) and apartheid in South Africa, they are always pitting minority groups against each other so that they won't focus on their oppressor

And I don't see how this could be any more fucking glaring than that the anti-gay people and anti-trans people are the same ones who are anti-BLM. The same people who keep passing laws specifically targeting Black people from voting

----

He also complained that Dababy got cancelled for being homophobic but not for murder. First, it's always easier for celebrities to attack individuals over attacking minorities

The CEO of papa john got cancelled for using the N word. Roseanne got cancelled for telling a Black person she looks like a monkey. Kramer got cancelled for using the N word

Laura Bush got away with running over and killing someone. Chris Brown got away with beating Rihanna. Don King stomped a guy to death and went on to become boxing's biggest promoter. Robert Richards, heir to the DuPont company, was convicted of raping his daughter and served no jail time. Attacks on individuals don't elicit the media attention like racism and homophobia do. But this is somehow the fault of the LGBTQ community?

Furthermore, social media backlash isn't a strong indicator of the extent to which systemic racism and homophobia is being addressed in our society. There's a still record high killings of trans people. Police can still largely murder Black people and face no legal repercussions

Actual cancellations from social media backlash are when corporations stop doing business with a person because their image no longer brings in the same revenue as when they hired them. This never really challenges the root power structures and phobias in our society. It doesn't matter how many celebrities throw their careers in toilet, it won't affect systemic racism in policing

-----

He complained 'to what extent am I obligated to participate in your self image'. He has none, but to what extent are they obligated to indulge in the idea that he is beyond criticism? To what extent should they suppress the fact that he is no longer a positive influence in their life

----

He complained about trans people using made up words to win arguments, but the majority of the terms that were coined for identifying phenomena regarding the marginalization of minorities came from the racial equality movements. It's mostly the anti-BLM people who criticize people for using terms like microaggressions

----

He blamed the LGBTQ community for taking away Kevin Hart's childhood dream of hosting the Oscars

First off, his old jokes were hurtful. Don Lemon did a great job of explaining why. I'm not going to link the youtube videos because that tends to get my comment deleted by the automod, but I'll just mention what to look up on youtube

Youtube Don Lemmon Kevin Hart 

And Kevin Hart later acknowledges at much, saying that he has grown since

Youtube Kevin Hart apology

But the issue is that he was adamant in not addressing it twice. But he never apologized the first time. He never apologized in every single interview he did about his hurtful comments prior to the Oscars; he defended himself each and every time until

Google the vulture.com article titled ""Where Are Kevin Harts Past Apologies? An Investigation""

If hosting the Oscars truly was Kevin's childhood dream and giving an apology (and instead lying about previously apologizing) was a boundary, then he has a ""Brittle-ass spirit"" (Dave's phrase for LouisCK victims)

Btw by his own usage of the terminology, Dave tried to 'cancel' Don Lemon

Youtube Don Lemmon responds to Chappelle

----

Regarding his trans friend's death, he cited her arguments on twitter as a possible cause for her death. I'm just going to skip over the point that twitter arguments bring the worst out of people in general (and not just LGBTQ people), I'm not going to buy that story just because Chappelle said it. Maybe it's true and maybe someone else can confirm it, but from the way Dave lied about the Kevin Hart and JK Rowling backlash, I'm not going to believe his story purely from his take on her situation

-----

Dave exclaims 'look how well the LGBTQ movement is going' as a comparison to the racial equality movement. There are instances where it may be useful to compare movements to better understand varying methods of minority marginalization, but this discussion is wholly incomplete without the discussion of areas where they are not comparable,  because systems of oppression uses different tactics to oppress different groups. In Chappelle's own HOME STATE of Ohio they passed a law that allows doctors to deny LGBTQ people health care on moral grounds. In 27 states, there are no explicit statewide laws at all protecting people from discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity in employment, housing and public accommodations. Which means in over half the country you can be fired or denied housing just for being gay or trans. Conversion therapy is legal in 30 states. Texas just banned a suicide hotline for LGBTQ youths

------

I don't think Dave was homophobic/transphobic in his initial specials. He had some cognitive biases which resulting in him saying some hurtful stuff. But his refusal to accept any criticism and the resulting backlash has resulted in a full blown fear -&gt; phobia of LGBTQ people besides 'the good ones' who are his friends. It's similar to a type of racism many white people have today; they believe in the idea of equality in general, but think the Black community are people hateful to white people when the kneel for the Anthem and criticize the police. They use isolated incidents like looting and random youtube videos to characterize the whole Black community. They think the average Black person has more privilege than the average white person by pointing to people being cancelled by racism the way Dave points to people being cancelled for homophobia. They think Black people are misguided in how they address systemic racism, and I feel Dave feels similarly about how LGBTQ address systemic homophobia and transphobia

Dave wants full equality for LGBTQ people but he didn't want them to address the very hurtful comments made by Kevin Hart or JK Rowling. He doesn't want them to call out people for using slurs; he complained about not being able to use the F-word slur. He also implied that the idea of the LGBTQ calling themselves 'my people' is racist, but at the end of the special used that exact phrase to refer to his fellow comedians, 'Stop punching down on my people'

He always tries to pit the LGBTQ community against the Black community. He complains about why is it easier for Bruce Jenner to change his gender than it was for Cassius Clay to change his name. Trans people EXISTED in the 60s, and throughout history. It wasn't easier, it took 50 years after the stonewall riots, which Dave actually referenced in his special. But why do this dumb game Dave wants us to play, does a person with cancer need to complain every time there's a breakthrough in AIDS research?

If his point is that the rich white power structures in our country are using LGBTQ issues to put down Black people, then he should go after the white power structures in our country directly and specifically. Maybe there are pockets of LGBTQ people putting down Black people like Peter Theil, but largely the white power structures strategy is to pit marginalized grounds against each other. The same people trying to put homophobia and transphobia into our school curriculum are the same ones who are trying to prevent Black people from voting

"I'm trans, and I totally agree with you, and I want to continue 

First, your third to last paragraph about Jenner should probably be put in quotes. I don't think *you* believe that about her, but you kinda accidentally phrased it that way.

while he said pro-trans things, he also said very anti-trans things. it mostly comes from the misunderstanding that gender and sex are different. its also offensive because the punchline of the jokes was that someone is trans. you can make jokes about the trans experience (most trans people do. going through a second puberty in adulthood can be pretty funny), much like dave chapelle does with the black experience. but thats not what most of the special was.",0.836,0.141,0.802,0.058
"&gt;""team TERF"" is the equivalent of a white comedian saying he supports blm and then saying they are team KKK and that race is a fact

You are correct in comparing TERFs to the KKK, because TERFs do not understand transpeople, they hate natal males, and wrongly spout that trans are all ""just perverts"".  This is harmful, but more importantly, it is **incorrect.**  It uses a double standard of logic (LGB sexualities are okay, but T sexualities are somehow ""perverted"" and invalid)

However in the rest of your comment, there's a wild difference between being ""team KKK"" and saying ""race is a fact"".  I haven't seen anybody get offended over 23andme tests yet.  

There actually are MYRIAD reasons to get offended over 23andme, because genetics/race are always presented from a eurocentric false reality.  But even if you got rid of the eurocentrism, the genetic differences would still exist.  And acknowledging the existence of those differences does not make you racist.  

Now extend this logic to transpeople.  There are (in 99.99% of cases) two different biological sexes.  Transpeople wish to be the opposite sex.  Of course, a male can never truly become a female, in the same way that a person of European ancestry can never become genetically Japanese.  

However, if a male DOES wish to be female, and she takes steps to emulate women visually and culturally, then I think that society owes it to her to not socially degrade her.  (the race equivalent of this would be a POC assimilating to European culture and also not being socially degraded.

as an aside, transracialism is an interesting debate, but since there isnt any data on individuals having racial dysphoria to even a fraction of a percentage trans individuals experience gender dysphoria (again gender, not sex, they identify as a different gender), at this time its kinda a moot point.",0.804,0.12,0.823,0.057
"It's also worth mentioning that sex is a far, far, more fundamental division than race.  There are millions of different ""races"", most of them now extinct or mixed, and the ones that exist today are simply mixes of the old ones.  

Race is multidimensional, sex is largely a dichotomy.  You can be North or Southeast Asian, Indian, African, European, North African, American Native etc et al.  But for sex, you are only male or female (for 99.99% of cases).  

Race can blend, sex can't.  Parents of different races form a genetic intermediate between them.  Parents of different sexes form...either sons or daughters.  

For this reason I don't support having transgender athletes in women's competitions.  But I do support bathroom choice and usage of appropriate him/her pronouns.

Its pretty simple. Youre saying that things you find distasteful should be censored, because youre part of a minority.

"Indeed. This is what we call sex: the body parts you are born with.

Gender is something else. Gender is about what you identify with yourself, and the social roles that come with it. As WHO puts it:
&gt; Gender refers to the socially constructed characteristics of women and men, such as norms, roles, and relationships of and between groups of women and men. It varies from society to society and can be changed.

Many people experience the same gender as their sex. But for some people, that just isn't right. 

Let me compare it to another experience a person might have. I will be utilising some stereotypes here; these are of course not entirely true, but allow for easier explanation.

You may have been born as a German person, you look like a German person, and you were raised as a German person. But no matter what you do, drinking beer while celebrating Oktoberfest doesn't work for you. That's not too bad yet, you can just not celebrate it. But the language sounds so crude to you. The people are just not your type. The terrain is beautiful, but not your thing. While this country is wonderful in its own way, you simply don't feel like you are one of its inhabitants. You don't feel at home here.  
Then one day, you go on vacation to France. What a beautiful language! You absolutely love the baguettes and the croissants. And everyone there seemed to understand you! While you may have been born a German, you feel much more at home in France. You haven't been born in France, but by moving here, you could enjoy life.",0.988,0.145,0.804,0.051

Tickle my brain here please.",0.696,0.108,0.868,0.024
"Yeah, you're right. It's just very hard to explain those internal feelings when you've never experienced them. And for many people, external pressure is both more obvious and easier to relate to, so it made for a better example. It's also why I tried to put the focus on ""it's a nice country, it just isn't for me"".

"I had the same argument with a person regarding with what you said. You're 1 of the 4 stated but majority of the time it's male or female an nothing else.

You can say whatever you are but if you have a penis you're a male, a vagina a female. It's like what defines a circle versus a square? A square will always have 4 corners and four equal sides.

This is what Chapelle did in his special. This is also what Ricky Gervais did in his Netflix stand up show. They told a degrading and negative jokes about a minority group they dont know anything about, to an audience of largely ignorant or uninformed people. No different to a white man telling derogatory jokes about black people to a white audience. Any right minded people would get up and walk out.

"Netflix has loads of transphobic content. If you dont watch comedy movies, sitcoms, stand up then you are unlikely going to come across it. Either that or you just dont recognise transphobia for what it is. 

All Chapelle did was the equivalent of a white comedian standing up and doing nearly a whole show making racist jokes about black or brown people to a room full of white people. Very much like what went on in the 70s. The kind of racist comedy that would never be allowed on modern day platforms. Its not funny and its not doing any minority community a favour. Its just telling a room full of ignorant people exactly what they want to hear so they have permission to laugh about people they dont like. Its not like Chapelle is a Jewish man making intelligent observational jokes about Jewish people and Jewish culture. Hes just ripping off the transphobia in the media and saying it on stage because its controversial and he makes money out of it.

And yes those communities targeted decades ago absolutely did protest about it. Regular white people initially got all defensive, going on about free speech and cant you take a joke, eventually most started to see the kind of comedy for the racism it actually was. Those comedians died out because no one wanted to watch that shit anymore.

After that, women, gay people, disabled people, and people of different ethnic backgrounds started to make their way into stand up and showed how comedy about these issues can be done properly and not just a mindless bigoted tirade. Sadly some comedians today dont seem to understand the difference between them taking the piss out of trans people today and comedians 40+ years ago taking the piss out of other minorities.

* He really plays up how good a friend she was, but then had to read her obituary to even find out she had a daughter? He was ranting about how she loved her more than life itself, but he didn't know that. I think he just felt guilty after her suicide.
* It's the entertainment industry. He's a comedian. She's a comedian. What's the fastest way to get yourself some notoriety? To befriend another famous comedian so that you become famous by association. Could it be that she *did not* find Chapelle humorous, but gritted through it because she saw this an opportunity for her career? How many women grit through sexual assaults because it would hurt their career? All too many.

This whole show, to me, was a comedian who was mad that a group of people that he'd been punching down on was mad at him. I bet if he took some time to listen to trans people and figure out what's going on and just barely educate himself on their struggles, he'd realize that he is, at his core, transphobic and that he's *actually* being transphobic all while claiming he's not. He's just doubling down on his hatred of trans people (trans women, specifically). Like there's a joke where the punchline is roughly ""You can't have a baby, so therefore you're not *actually* a woman."" To me that's not a joke. That's punching down at someone. But... Chapelle doesn't care, and doesn't care to educate himself, so he doesn't understand. I'm a regular old white dude and if I literally made national headlines claiming that I'm racist, I'd take that as an opportunity to reevaluate what I'm doing.  If two tumblr blogs were saying I'm racist, that's probably just random internet person shouting into the void. But when the Washington Post is pointing at me, calling me racist on a global scale? You know? Just *maaaaaybe* I'm in the wrong here. Maaaaybe there's something going on here which I don't understand.

I could go on. Like how he doesn't like ""New Gays"". He's likes those ""Stonewall Gays"" who were tough. All while completely ignorant that Stonewall was pushed forward though the work of trans people. (or, that he is willfully ignoring Stonewall because it was black and latina trans women? He did clearly say that his problem is with white people afterall).

Like how he keeps minimizing trans and LGBT struggles when compared to black people, like ""why are you, a black person, supporting this trans person?"" All while being completely ignorant of the Holocaust apparently.

"I was brainwashed as a kid to believe I was straight. 

Then I discovered how important gender and anatomy were to me in a partner. The gayness of my body was not a match for the femaleness of her body. 

I get why gender and anatomy are so important to me, and I just know what I need. So I have a huge amount of empathy for anyone who looks in the mirror and doesnt see what they need about themselves. To me that should be enough common ground to build a community on. 

The only problems I have at the moment is first, a bunch of loudmouth entitled activists where that empathy doesnt go both ways, and my very gay, fundamental, definitional needs for gender and anatomy in a partner are dismissed as trivial, unimportant, or even bigotry. A few hostile homophobes trying to retcon their way into any definition of my sexuality. (A few. Inflamed and amplified by trolls, both amateurs, and probably some professional troll farms funded by totalitarian regimes sewing division). 

And then the other problem is maybe understandable or inevitable for people in a difficult situation who cant abide what they see when they look in the mirror: sure, change your body, your presentation, your wardrobe, your pronouns, your physiology to the extent that you can. But dont expect that the desire for transformation, or attempts at transformation, will result in actual complete, fully-realized transformation. Thats the wishful thinking part where reality must intrude. Not out of malice or prejudice, but out of recognition that the result of transformation is still fundamentally intermediate, in meaningful and consequential ways. 

The willingness to pretend that isnt a thing. The willingness to gloss over intermediacy and pretend it doesnt matter, the willingness to command all G and L to become pan, is fundamentally toxic to at least the G and L members of GLBT, and ignores the trauma of the brainwashing that many gays endured as children expected to become straight, as well as the lessons we learnt from it. Ignores it. Is hostile to it. Etc.",0.618,0.102,0.804,0.094
"the two can exist together lol. im gay but started to question my gender identity over the course of covid, especially after having conversations with my friends about it. 

gay men exist in this weird space where we label ourselves as men but arent what a traditional man is like. i think the whole identity of being a masc man is grounded in toxic masculinity and something thats hard pressed to coexist with being gay. im not out to the world about it, but i think i fall more in line with he/they pronouns because i dont see myself as being purely cis. 

not gonna speak for everyone, but a lot of young people ive met feel the same way. im 22 and most of my friends are around my age and feel similarly. i even have a friend whos in the closet and didnt like being called sis because he equated it to me insinuating hes feminine because hes gay. i had a conversation about why i would call him sis and about how its similar to saying bro. thats when he ended up telling me stuff about how the gender binary has felt hard to maneuver being gay and closeted. 

im not saying everyone has to agree with me. your gender identity is 100% your own and i cant change how you feel about labeling yourself as cis. however, i 100% agree with saying that the T belongs with the LGB, weve fought too many of the same battles for the last few decades to exclude them now.",0.953,0.098,0.854,0.048

"I think your comment just proved Dave Chappelle's one. Why would Black Trans people have lower life expectancy than their white counterparts? Because of racism. Racism isn't taken seriously, still. I think Dave Chappelle's point(and he said as much) is the surprising leaps that the LGBTQ+ movement has made in a few decades and how few the antiracism movement has gotten, even if it's hundreds of years old. The point is that because LGBTQ+ is also a white problem, that's why you see a huge progress there. I mean, Black Heritage month gets a few mentions and Pride Month gets all corporations selling rainbow colored products and issuing statements on how ""LGBTQ+friendly"" they are. Black Lives Matter was such a political hot potato (even though we all saw the unedited video) that few corporations came in support of the movement. It's an interesting conversation to be had and something that must be addressed, since racism within the LGBTQ+ community is well documented and rampant. I know this because when interacting with friends of friends who are LBGTQ I noticed a trend of racism. Didn't think anything of it until one brown friend told me all they have to put up with within the community and that's when I started reading and boy is it awful. So I think that Dave Chappelle talking for all African American is good for those Black Trans people that just because they are black they can expect a lower life expectancy. This is coming from a guy who refused to watch any of Dave Chappelle's specials on Netflix because I thought he was a bigot mascarading discrimination with comedy (having not watched any of his material prior to this special) I was very surprised on how much this special ratrled me and made me think. I was not expecting it to be deep and deeply affecting. Links for the racism in the LGBTQ+ community https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/nov/24/no-asians-no-blacks-gay-people-racism

"You aren't wrong, and I think it's ironic af that  you're being downvoted for it (I'm trans, for reference). It's pretty well known in the lgbtq community that the elephant in the room of racism is...well, it's a fucking problem, both in outright bigotry, and in fetishization. 

I see it more than I'd like to admit, *especially* among white cis gay men  not that everyone else is perfect, but it seems more pronounced from them in particular, with more than a few examples of racism, transphobia, and misogyny (seriously, take a peek at r/askgaybros for examples of what I mean  you don't even need to sort by controversial.

"But Black trans people have a lower life expectancy than Black cis people. Comparing marginalisation isn't the point. It's not 'Black trans people have it worse because they're Black.'. It's because they're Black *and* trans. And to try and view those as distinct forms of marginalisation misses the point that they face shit that white trans people, and Black cis people don't. Their experiences are uniquely shaped by a white supremacist cisnormative system.

So when Chapelle treats being trans as a 'white person thing', he's not just drawing attention to the very real racism within the queer community. He's implying that the queer community is inherently white, erasing queer people of colour, and potentially making them feel even less welcome. Because now they have to contend with people like him implying that they don't exist, or are acting like white people, or are doing it because they don't have real problems.",-0.806,0.091,0.794,0.115

The thing I love about comedy is the tendency is self deprecation and self humour, and Chappelle just feels like the opposite now. People have called him the GOAT for so long that he sounds entitled.

"This was pretty much my take away as well. For all the hate and criticism the worst part of the special was that it was really mediocre work. His social commentary was accurate about as often as it was off-base, and he's a comedian so yeah, he doesn't step lightly and it's gonna offend people. But through and through *The Closer* just wasn't very funny. Like I'm glad the guy is taking time off and stepping back from LGBTQ stuff - because more and more lately he's just not producing stuff that makes me laugh - and it has less to do with offending me and more to do with the jokes just being weak.

The one thing I will say is that Dave treats the LGBTQ movement as a total monolith in his work and that's a really poor interpretation of things. The trans community experiences far more discrimination and hate than other groups and if you hear Dave tell it they've got the world at their fingertips. This misconception, along with a lot of unwillingness to grapple with the fact that black LGBTQ folks get so much hate from their own community (and how his comedy can impact/reinforce this) isn't a great look.

In the end Dave demonstrates a lot of ignorance on the issue(s), but simultaneously shows empathy and offers a valuable perspective at times. It's complicated, but I came away from the special thinking ""it isn't very good, but it isn't as horrific as it was made out to be."" Mostly I came away thinking ""this wasn't very funny.""",-0.964,0.111,0.725,0.164

There are plenty of issues to address with social progression, and there are plenty of extreme views on the left that are ridiculous and dangerous, as there are on the right.

Like, yes, white privilege is a phenomenon that extends into other minority struggles, including black American politics (light skinned black people are broadly more palatable in the media and society than dark skinned black people) but his focus seems to be on denigrating all LGBTQ issues and taking the piss out of any of them that are too far away from what he's deemed ok. And the fact is, he's not acting as a comedian. He's just ranting about his own opinions, and many comedians do, but it means noone can play the ""just jokes"" card whenever he's called out.

One of the last things he said was ""I'm not going to say any more on this issue till I'm convinced [the trans community and I] are laughing together"" or something along those lines. And yet, after he wrote that as the closing sentiment of his show, he still delivered the whole show first on netflix taking the piss out of various LGBTQ stuff before Closer actually closed.

I think what irritates me most about Chappelle's special apart from being transphobic is that he won't own up to it.

I saw George Carlin live, and he was working up material for his next special. He flat out told the audience at the beginning ""I'm about halfway through the process. Some stuff won't land"". 

I did eventually see the special, a year or so later. About 85% familiar, although the pacing and phrasing had changed in a lot of the stuff I recognized.

Some of that was to make jokes land better. Some of it was clearly to add edge, take off edge, or otherwise tweak a joke -- because good comedians walk a pretty fine line.

Carlin could afford to work up a whole set mostly from scratch, but I suspect any comedian trials new jokes and timings when they're on the road, trying to find something that lands on the right side of the line for their audience.

Cut off comics from audiences, though, and you tend to get really self-referential bullshit that walks the *comedian's* (and his friends) line, and can leave the audience cold.",0.833,0.132,0.803,0.066

Anyone who tells you otherwise is lying. (I'm not talking making jokes with your friends. You know them. You know where their line is.).

Seinfeld? He's made fucking bank. And he coasted on it. No problem there. Why should he do the hard, grinding work of staying relevant -- especially to younger crowds -- when he can be rich and famous and *not* do that?

The downside is, you know, he slowly fades away. He's not a driving force in comedy, younger audiences don't like his stuff as much, and he slowly loses selling power as he ""ages out"" of the prime demographics.

So coast all you want. Just...don't bitch that people half your age find your jokes stale and old. You stopped *working* at it. Go tell them to the folks in their 50s and 60s who loved your old shit, and don't get the 30 year olds *either*.

Lenny Bruce was one of the preeminent comedians of the early 60s. He was incredibly edgy for the time to the point of being arrested on obscenities charges  multiple times (which is how society tried to cancel performers prior to the advent of social media). 

It infuriated him being persecuted for *words*. He vented that fury the only way he knew how: on stage. Hed go on and on about how the cops treated him and how the judges hated him launching into furious tirades against the hateful, ignorant world that was trying to shut him up. And as true as all that was& *it wasnt funny.* 

To this day, when people discuss Lenny Bruce in terms of his legacy, no one talks about his late work its all about the adventurous, clever early stuff. Its sad to think of how much more greatness he mightve had in him if he werent so preoccupied with making himself into a martyr.",-0.986,0.099,0.693,0.209
"Chappelle is more like a social activist than a stand up comedian at this point. Which is fair. He came back after massive burnout and has been very upfront that he's not playing by anyone's rules anymore. And that's fine.

I think the controversy stems from people's expectations of him, not what he chooses to express in his specials.

I think most people like myself miss the Chappelle that seemed like he was earnestly having fun despite the unseen bullshit that comes with Hollywood, media corps, fame, etc. That Chappelle was always fun. I personally thought that Era of comedy actually worked well to desegregate black culture, and Chapelle was an essential part of that. 

Honestly, Chappelle Show, and other black comic specials / black comedy movies helped me sympathize with the day to day bullshit that I don't see, but in a fun and inclusive way. I had zero interest in black pop culture at all before Chappelle Show, Black Friday, Up in Smoke, Boondocks, etc. It just wasn't very consumable to me.

But on the other side of it, and the side that really bothered Chappelle, was that many abused the blurring of lines, and used it to marginalize the issues that these comics highlighted in entertaining ways. Then the ""trigger"" / ""woke"" social paradigm shift happened.

Those two negatives was probably why Chappelle returned as basically a charismatic social warrior. His intent doesn't seem to be to make people laugh. Humor is just a vehicle to get people to listen to the points he wants to make. He's more of an activist than comedian now.

And that's OK. I personally like to hear what his thoughts are on race/social orientation topics. I don't always agree, but his arguments are thoughtful. But I think he always did that to a lesser degree, and it was more the subtext of his comedy that obviously many missed.

He also suggested that people were perhaps laughing at these types of jokes without having the underlying racial understanding of *why* the jokes work the way they do, because they simply hadn't lived those experiences. I guess he felt it was cheapening the underlying factors. 

I'm probably misquoting it - the show is ""My next guess requires no introduction"" or something and the story is addressed near the start of the ep.",0.745,0.128,0.796,0.076
"This is the thing people are missing. They assume that everyone who dislikes Dave's point is angry about beet juice jokes or something. I laughed at a lot of the jokes in the special but I found his overall point wrongheaded and hypocritical. But because I disagree I must be a snowflake or something...

Dave ends the show by preaching empathy. Empathy is about standing in someone else's shoes and feeling what they feel. He never does that in the show.

He wants a lazy empathy. An empathy where you don't have to understand other people, an empathy where you can call them what you like despite knowing it hurts them, an empathy where you get to decide if the things you are saying are okay or not, an empathy where you twist everything about their experiences to match your understanding of the world. But so long as you don't 'actually' hate them its fine. The hypocritical part is that when white people do this to Dave Chapelle, he doesn't buy it. But he wants trans people to buy it from him.

Dave was offerred millions for his comedy but he turned it down on principle - he felt he wouldn't be respected, he didn't want to be controlled, and he felt his comedy was resulting in people laughing AT black people not with them. But he thinks that the fact that he gave a trans person a million dollar opportunity should win us over to his side even though he is dismissive and disrespectful of them.

Trans people can be crazy, like any people. A lot of it is Twitter culture, not trans culture. But even the parts where people are being 'crazy' you should at least acknowledge that it comes from fear and trauma. Dave could've made a joke about how SOME people in the trans community use their legitimate fear to manipulate them. Instead, his explanation is that when trans people do things that are out of line, its because of racism. Why racism? Because that's what Dave Chapelle understands.

Throughout the entire show Dave positions himself as the arbiter of what's okay and not. Misgendering your trans friend is like a white person telling jokes about why they can't say the N-word and then using it to drive home a point about how empathetic you are. If you can't respect me enough to call me what I want to be called, then you don't get to pretend you're a good person. A lot of people do this when it comes to LGBT, they want to have the kumbaya stuff without the respect. Dave would never tolerate white people who insist on calling him what they want and mocking him, but say its okay because they like him deep down inside.

And the most painful thing is how he tries to pit 'blacks against queers'. Someone in the thread mentioned that he made an example of two black gay guys in his show so he acknowledges them. But in that very scene he was trying to use their blackness to diminish someone else's point about queer suffering. The same scene where he joked the trans people aren't really a people because they didn't come from Transylvania...

In a few specials back, Dave joked about this trans woman who was being super cautious to disclose to him that she was trans after they hit it up in the club. He made fun of her like she was crazy to be so cautious. And then he went on to tell the story of Emmet Till in a very sincere and sombre way. Trans people are getting killed today for the crime of hitting on the wrong person, but Dave is oblivious to that.... Even while he is talking about how Emmet Till was killed for the same thing.

Dave, and so many other faux allies, want lazy, easy empathy. They want trans people like Daphne who make their lives easy because when someone shouts at them they have a witty comeback and everything ends up okay. But the real world is full of trans people who, after they were harassed by some straight guy in a club, had the shit beaten out of them. And those are the people Dave Chapelle just ignores. Of all the stories I've bullying and violence Dave could find regarding trans people, he chose the one where trans people bullied a trans person.

Dave and his fans frame his content as enlightened social commentary on the trans situation. He doesn't even touch half of the stuff that queer and trans lives are actually about. All he discusses are the stuff that he sees, experiences and which make his life difficult. And he always discusses it by choosing the laziest form of empathy - where you don't need anything from me, and I get to choose how I will help or not help you and how I will show you respect or not. I will do or say whatever I want when it comes to you, but since in my heart I don't hate you it doesn't matter how you feel about it actually.

I am a Chappelle fan. I have seen him in person and I believe I have seen or listened to all his work. I never considered Chappelle the quite the GOAT but I would have put him probably in my top 5. Speaking only about the comedic aspect of The Closer, it was in my opinion possibly his worst stand-up special. I laughed a few times but I expected better once it hit the 2nd half of the special and it was focused so much on that singular issue i wasn't offended exactly, but it felt lazy.

Comedians that do a special like this work on their act for many months at least. Every single word choice, pacing, pauses is worked on. Most people have no idea how work goes into every second of an act like this. I can't say for sure about Chappelle as I have not heard him speak to this level on his craft, but this was a very scripted work as with all stand ups.

So much of the second half of this act regarding transgenders felt like some B tier level comedy at best. He wasn't bombing in my opinion but it was not the work of the GOAT by any means. I understood most all his points and even agreed or could see that side of things but you don't need to get in those little calculated jabs at another marginalized community while talking about it, even if you craft the joke as how you react to them and not punch down. I don't feel like he ever crossed some terrible PC line, but he did a bad job at providing a stand up special for sure. Just my two cents.

All this controversy is driving tons of people to go watch his special, but instead of seeing a great standup special they are seeing his worst, in my opinion of all time. People that are not familiar with his past work will walk away wondering why people thought he was so great. Imagine if he would have put on a GOAT like performance instead. He would have brought in a whole new audience and fan base. Put another comedian in this place with months to prepare for this, a great comedian would have knocked it out of the park. He failed. Period. This is a Chappelle fan saying that. I like the guy and I hope he gets past this and puts out new work that lives up to what he can do.

I can only make un-informed speculations on why he chose to have the special like this. Maybe he is so rich and disconnected from normal people that he thought this was the GOAT response and it would be received well? Maybe he just doesn't care anymore? I don't know I can only guess.

"Being trans is not inherently funny, but I believe it's possible for comedians to write jokes about things that aren't funny. Granted, it takes talent and nuance, and often, it comes from people closest to that issue. Chappelle can write jokes about racism, which is also not inherently funny, that people affected by racism still laugh at and enjoy. He failed to find that kind of joke about trans people, despite devoting the majority of the special's time to the subject.

As a trans woman, I want someone to find the humor in thisit would be therapeutic, cathartic. But it's always the same categories of jokes, no matter how skilled the comedian is on other topics. It's attack helicopters, and chopping dicks off, and ""oh no, that person didn't have the parts I was expecting."" It's tall, deep-voiced trans women introducing themselves with feminine names (or, in the case of Dave's special, someone at the urinal with genitals you wouldn't expect). The mismatch between someone's expressed gender and their body, and that's supposed to be the whole joke. Just, this person, being who they arefunny, right? But for a topic that isn't *inherently* funny, that doesn't work. Or rather, it only works on people who already find the situation inherently funnyi.e., transphobes. And those jokes say to the transphobes ""Don't worry, you can still be transphobic, because you're right. We're all laughing and cringing alongside you. Nobody takes them seriously."" That's what punching down is. It's not joking *about* the marginalized, the helpless, the oppressed. It's telling jokes *for* the majority, the powerful, the oppressors.

From Wikipedia:

&gt;Social liberalism (German: Sozialliberalismus, Spanish: socioliberalismo), also known as new liberalism in the United Kingdom, modern liberalism in the United States, left liberalism (German: Linksliberalismus) in Germany and progressive liberalism (Spanish: Liberalismo progresista) in Spanish-speaking countries is a political philosophy and variety of liberalism that endorses a social market economy within an individualist economy and the expansion of civil and political rights. Under social liberalism, the common good is viewed as harmonious with the freedom of the individual.

&gt;Social liberal policies have been widely adopted in much of the world. Social liberal ideas and parties tend to be considered centrist or centre-left.

&gt;In Europe, social liberal parties tend to be small or medium-sized centrist and centre-left parties. Examples of successful European social liberal parties which have participated in government coalitions at national or regional levels include the Liberal Democrats in the United Kingdom, the Democrats 66 in the Netherlands, and the Danish Social Liberal Party.

Social liberalism is a thing that exists in pretty much every country in the world.

&gt;And liberals are considered right wing by most margins in the world

Classical liberals are considered right-wing in most of the world, as well as in the US, but social liberalism and classical liberalism are two distinct ideologies. Depending on the context (what country you're in, what political terminology is used, how you're using it in a sentence, etc.) most people tend to understand if you're talking about a right or left-wing liberal.",0.967,0.113,0.887,0

"Yeah, both forms of liberalism have their roots in 19th century ""liberal"" thought where the goal was to maximize individual freedoms: freedom of speech and religion, expanded civil liberties, cultural liberalism, market freedom (this being a time when unelected lords and monarchs had tight control on the markets for their own benefits).

However, towards end of the 19th century a faction of liberal thinkers began to see flaws in certain economic liberal ideas and began to urge reform. They thought of the state as being a useful tool in helping to maximize individual freedoms. These thinkers were called new liberals or social liberals (because they took some of their ideas from socialist thought). In Europe there are still a lot of social liberal parties but many got absorbed in social democratic parties (the two ideologies being very similar). In the US the success and popularity of FDRs social liberal policies led to the end of the term ""classical liberalism"" by the right in favor of the term ""fiscal conservatism"".",0.985,0.195,0.805,0

- destroyed mental healthcare, especially for the youth, by dumping all responsibility on the local governments and giving them a paycut as well, which has led to severe problems of increased waiting time and actively stimulating health insurance companies to cut off funding for long-term mental help because it isnt profitable enough 

- refuses to invest properly in any public service job, leaving the workers underpaid and overworked and leading to massive shortages in nurses and teachers

- introduce student debt that also counts for mortgage sign-ups, leaving starters on the market even more fucked than they already would be

- having zero interest in investing in our tax controllers and ignoring plights to close off roads to tax havens, while also having a brutal policy on regular citizens committing fraud with social service funding (aka every little mistake on a form and youre immediately ostracized and branded as a fraudster for life)

- being really fucking slow with any climate change measure and fully relying on the benevolence of corporations to do their work for them (and selling clean power to Microsoft data centers as if we dont need that power ourselves)

The social form of liberalism is often used interchangeably with progressivism (although there are distinctions between the two). In that sense, calling it left-wing is not inaccurate. 

The economic form of liberalism is generally in line with laissez-faire capitalism (touted as classical liberalism), or at the very least the striving towards a minimal influence of the state on the free market. In this sense, it is absolutely right of center. 

IMHO, the right-wing/left-wing distinction is dogshit and outdated anyway. Especially with more modern movements like liberalism, a one-dimensional approach falls short.

Netflix spent $ 24.1 million on The Closer, slightly more than the $ 23.6 million it paid for Chappelles 2019 special, Sticks &amp; Stones. By comparison, the streaming service spent $ 3.9 million on Inside, Bo Burnhams recent 1.5-hour special. The nine-part Squid Game, which made the best debut in Netflix history, cost $ 21.4 million.

&gt;According to Netflixs own measurements, Sticks &amp; Stones had an impact value of $ 19.4 million, meaning it cost more than the value it generated, according to internal documents reviewed by Bloomberg. The company also rates its programs by effectiveness, which balances a shows reach with its price. On this scale, Chappelles special scored 0.8  less than the break-even point of 1. By comparison, Burnhams Inside scored 2.8.",0.958,0.136,0.853,0.011

I watched a few of his stand-ups from the last few years and just wasn't super impressed. It was fine, but like you said, he's now insanely wealthy and much older so he isn't the same person he was 20 years ago. Haven't even bothered to watch his new special yet because I have a feeling it's gonna the same thing (and that's not even touching the trans controversy), plus the last 15 years of TV and movies have created so much insanely good content that I have other things higher up on the watchlist.",0.982,0.215,0.728,0.057

I mean, okay, he's rich and famous now. *really* rich and famous. That's not terribly relatable to audiences, and it cuts out a lot of avenues to connect. I can understand him not wanting to mine his old stuff too hard, 

So he's probably forced to move into more global areas -- politics, current events, cultural stuff that's not *directly* related to him.  And maybe rich and famous perspective on those just isn't connecting as well to his audience, but...he's sheltered by his wealth and fame, so how the fuck would he *know*? Especially if he's gaving 20m a show thrown to him for his opinions?

Take Seinfeld. Dude's rich, famous, sheltered, and 67 years old. he was bitching about college kids *don't get him* and blaming PC culture or something similar.

Nah, dude, you're a rich white guy almost 50 years older than those audiences. You've got nothing in common with them, other than living in the same basic country -- and your jokes have always been observational about your life and interactions. Not more global stuff like politics or current events.  

The problem isn't dumb, sheltered, PC college kids here so much as it is ""aging comedian rails against kids these days"" because he can't *fathom* he's no longer hip and young. He doesn't give a shit about what they give a shit about, and somehow *they're* to blame for not agreeing with him.

They watched it, and they liked it. And you don't like it, but you haven't watched it. So once you watch it, you'll **get it**. And if you don't, then you didn't understand, and you need to watch some other stuff to **get it**. 

And to them, **it** isn't the transphobia/homophobia/racism/etc, because those are things that mean 'bad', and, well, they're not bad, because if they were bad, then they would stop being bad, right? So obviously, you just don't **get it**. 

Online is the worst place to talk about this stuff, but in my own experiences (whatever that's worth), I've found that for a lot of these people, if you can sit down with them and actually get them to think about it, actually address what **it** is, they're usually willing to change some of their ideas.

Seriously I don't get how anyone could watch the special and believe that he was actually close to her.

Then has the gall to suggest that Daphne being harassed by trans people for defending him was the reason she committed suicide.

[Based on this article ](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.inquirer.com/news/daphne-dorman-suicide-dave-chappelle-netflix-sticks-and-stones-20191014.html%3foutputType=amp) Daphne defended him on 29 August, and Daphne then opened for Chapelle on 26 September. Chapelle's account of her show was that she was awful and no one laughed during the entirety of it, and that it was painful to watch. Daphne committed suicide on 12 October. Pretty ridiculous given the timeline for Chapelle to suggest that the Twitter abuse was the reason she was driven to suicide, or for him to suggest that they were very good friends / they were of the same tribe as comedians given he only saw her perform once right before she died. 

Which makes it all the more fucking galling for him to misgender her due to her method of suicide and trying to say the joke was okay, Daphne would have laughed. Like he actually knew her and her humour intimately. And I can't speak for Daphne, but for myself, having dealt with suicidal ideation in the past, I would not fucking find it funny for someone to make light of my suicide to score a cheap and shitty 'joke', not even accounting for the awful context surrounding it.",-0.956,0.111,0.748,0.142

I feel like this is just basic levels of conversational understanding, the concept of conveying two ideas near each other because you know people are going to conflate the two is not a new concept, and he was doing even more than that by directly bringing up the possibility that it might be true. He did everything possible to draw a connection and then was like ""I don't know"".

If someone says a bunch of anti-vax talking points and then is like ""But who knows really? I'm not anti-vax"" are you just going to be like ""Oh well, they said 'no anti-vax' so they're obviously not anti-vax"".

Notoriously, it's used by racists to say racist as fuck shit with plausible deniability. Jordan Peterson does it a lot. It's basically Trump's modus operandi.

But even accepting your logic, being unsure if Twitter harassment was a factor in someone's decision to *kill themselves* still seems at odds with his conclusion that he doesn't care because ""Twitter isn't real"". It might have been a contributing factor in someone's death which seems real enough to me.

"I still remember watching the Prince Hoops skit and almost dying laughing. It was a recommendation from some Yank friends and I loved the first two seasons (from the internet because Chappelle has never been aired in Spain) even if I found some racial ovetones a bit cringey.

Dave shitting on racism tropes was magnificent, but the apropiation of racist tropes when applied to black culture skirted too close to minstrelsy for my liking. It felt awkward in a way I could not really explain until I watched Atlanta, a much better show from a much better comedian.

Still, I could not be but inspired by Dave's giant fuck you to the industry and defence of creative integrity. I tried to keep up with his projects, nonetheless and was really Happy when he started releasing comedy specials again.

Now I think It is time to stress how much I love comedy and yet how hard It is to make me laugh. 90% of supposedly hilarious shows and comedians leave me dead fish cold. 

So anyway, I watch the first comeback special and it's alright. But not nearly enough for my standards, plus Chappelle seems to be doubling down on the cringey jokes he seems to love telling white people.

But still, let's give the man a second chance, eh?

I lasted fifteen minutes. It was then I realized the original series, besides Chappelle's brilliance, featured an all star roster of black comedians, he had a writing room, corporate guiding, so maybe this was much more of a team effort than we realized.

Never bothered again with his specials but when they popped on Netflix I placed them on the maybe list.

A day later I saw the infamous trans segment and I inmediately knew Chappelle had swerved his style to the kind of confrontational edgy jokes I despised on his repertory. I lost all interest.

Finally, he went full mental, even claiming to be a TERF, misrepresenting what being a TERF means and basically acting like he was auditioning for a slot on FOX News.

Like, maybe it's because I'm at just the right age or something, but I actually cannot think of another comedian I've heard more quoted or discussed in my life. Even after he ""retired"" people were still talking about him constantly, and none of the other comedians I see people name-checking here came even close.

**EDIT**:  WSJ did about a [15 minute podcast story](https://gimletmedia.com/shows/the-journal/n8h29v3/the-chappelle-controversy-tests-netflix) on this exact issue today if you prefer to give that listen.  Far more insight into Netflix's motives and culture then my comment.

----
 Chapelle's recent Neflix special (*The Closer*) addressed his strained relatinoship with the LGBTQ community and repeatedly accused of ""punching down"" at them with his jokes (which he believes was unfair criticism) Especially when, black people as a race, don't get the same treatment and it's essentially impossible for a more oppressed class of people to ""punch down"".

Chappelle argues that the people who are most angry at him are the ones who only hear his soundbites as opposed to whole sets.  He also talked about his close relationship with a trans comedian Daphne Dorman who committed suicide, and how they could connect on a human level and laugh despite being offended.  But Chappelle's critics said he only used her as a shield to cover his transphobia (meanwhile Dorman's family stands besides Chappelle)  ~~And though he doesn't say it~~, she was brutally criticized and harassed by other trans people and allies for defending Chapelle's last special shortly before committing suicide.  This is the ""cancel culture"" that I think that Chapelle was also railing against in the special.  Though most, if not all, Daphne's family stands behind Dave Chapelle.

Over the years, Chappelle has built plenty of jokes around trans subjects, including in three of his most recent stand-up specials for Netflix. And Chapelle does make several jokes at the expense of trans community throughout the episode. He expresses discomfort at being tricked into calling a trans woman beautiful (not really tricked but attempted to be ""setup""), likens trans women to white people wearing blackface and compares the genitalia of trans women to plant-based meat. He also aligns himself with J.K. Rowling and calls himself Team TERF, stating, gender is a fact. (the latter seems to be the most infuriating for his critics)  

The walkout is the reaction of Netflix employees to have Netflix change their policies.  Though some have been suspended (attending unauthorized meetings) or fired (sharing confidential show metrics) during the course of these protests.  Netflixs co-chief executive Ted Sarandos, meanwhile, sent a memo to employees addressing the situation and arguing that The Closer didnt cross the line of inciting hate or violence; he vowed to leave the special up on the site no matter how loud the criticism became.  So now employees are just continuing to protest to get, what they view, as more trans positive inclusive programming and policies at Netflix.

"But that's not why he walked away from all that.  He hated to see his comedy be so commoditized that it was robbed of it's actual meaning and point, and then to become such an authority on all he makes his shows about that literally he cannot make a joke about something in a manner he uses as material anyways.  (Plus to see his own material used to exploit his own people, contribute to another system of pure exploitation , incidentally contribute to the Hollywood system by continuing to work in it, etc...). A finer point that I heard him mention on in the actors studio, was that he didn't feel good about the comedy that he was making, as it wasn't facilitating truth and reconciliation between people, just further defining the ""other"" and reinforcing the same issues he was pointing out.  

If you listen to his material in it's context, you would know to not take his material at face value.  It serves to showcase an exaggerated viewpoint to see the hypocrisy of being sensitive while not observing or understanding subtly, because everything is so exaggerated lately that no one can say anything publicly without it getting exaggerated.  

Personally, I think he's doing the same thing again, drawing the public eye to a problem the only way he knows how, making jokes and material that is potentially more genuine and thought provoking, and showcasing the subtlety required to discuss such things in public.  Everything gets exaggerated though, which stops productive discussion in its tracks, because subtle differences is kinda what defines everyone, and is therefore universal. Calling out identity politics on the way, of course.  Because no one is only one thing, but everyone IS human, and has struggles.  Those struggles are just different for everyone.

Even without the trans stuff, his sets are mediocre at best now. There is no real point or message, just an old man complaining about the way times have changed.

But the reason he needed time off was because of his feeling that his jokes were having a harmful effect. And he didn't want those skits released. Their violation of that is also a contributing factor in why he chose to not return, but again it stemmed from the skits and that laughter giving him that feeling.

Dorman's sister does not think her sister committed suicide due to harassment, but instead due to PTSD. However, everything else seems to indicate that she likes Chapelle, thought the special was good, and thought it honored Dorman.

From looking at the Wayback machine, the idea Dorman was being significantly harassed on Twitter seems very unlikely; there's basically no public negativity/harassment, and Twitter isn't a site where people stick to DMs for shitty messages.

"I can tell you didn't watch the show because this was one of the early jokes/stories in the first quarter of the show and culminated in this story.  The point was in how white LGBT members can claim they are a minority but it's far easier to hide then race.

&gt; and get you
&gt; to say something stupid or dumb
&gt; so that their buddies can film it
&gt; and get a video

&gt; ""This is what is happening.""
&gt; And these dumb motherfuckers thought,
&gt; it was my first rodeo.
&gt; [laughter]
&gt; [applause]
&gt; Sadly it worked.
&gt; [audience laughs]
&gt; I ran right over there, I said--
&gt; I pointed right in the camera
&gt; I said, ""You is a bitch-ass nigga
&gt; for doing this to me.""
&gt; [audience laughs]
&gt; And the dude was shocked
&gt; that I said it. He said ""Huh?""
&gt; And when he did like this,
&gt; I've seen all his fingernails
&gt; is painted and I realized like,
&gt; ""Oh-oh.""
&gt; [laughter]
&gt; ""This fellow is gay.""
&gt; Yeah, you know how I talk.
&gt; I call everybody a bitch-ass nigga.
&gt; You know what I mean?
&gt; But that is not a right thing to do
&gt; if they're gay. You know what I mean?

&gt; the motherfucker was huge.

&gt; in a knot like this.
&gt; Oh, fuck this guy.

&gt; I thought we were going

"&gt; It's North Carolina so I doubt they would have just given this dude a pass, especially considering he wasn't very famous at the time

It was also black-on-black crime which I don't think the police really give that many fucks about. Maybe it was self-defense. Maybe it wasn't. My point is that it really doesn't matter. We don't care. For example, DaBaby has also been alleged to have been involved in another violent crime as well as slapping a female fan in the face.

But even if DaBaby's entirely on the level, I still think Dave's broader point stands... we have weird double standards for what constitutes a cancelable offense. Snoop's murder charge? Yeah, we're fine with that. ~~Jay-Z~~ Dre beating the shit out of a female reporter? Okay, we'll let it slide. Chris Brown slapping around Rihanna? Some consequences, but we are cool with him now. Say some ignorant shit on stage about gay people? Nah... fuck that. Can't have that kind of language in a civilized society.

I wasn't a big fan of Dave's new special because it just wasn't that funny (though it had moments). But, I do think it is prescient - he's taking the hypocrisy of white activism head-on, and through that lens, it is exceptionally accurate.

I mean an issue with that is these artists are also heavily supported in the black community and that's where there origins are.

What's it like going so hard on that when you're so wrong?

I watched it. Maybe you'd know that if you cared enough about not being wrong. But nah you had to assume because it makes you feel correct without having to actually analyze your positions.

That's literally what always happens, you moron. She also died shortly after another dave special brought on waves of twitter hate, just like this one has. This happens every time he does a special. So abruptly thrusting a previously no name manic trans comic with ptsd into the global spotlight with a clearly divisive special is totally fine? But you didn't hear me talk about that until now, because ultimately I don't know why she died and neither do you. I know lots of trans people kill themselves and most of them werent at the center of a conflict like this, so maybe the statistics aren't on your side. If I was going around saying the only reason the killed herself is because the twitter comments made her realize what she did and she couldnt take it, I'd sound as fucking stupid as you.

It's like you're intentionally missing the point. People who are against the idea of ""you can make fun of everything"" often argue that you shouldn't punch down. The argument is that even if one were to accept this premise it wouldn't be punching down, therefore the critics don't have a leg to stand on.

Personally I think sometimes Dave shoves racism into places where they're not really relevant so I don't know whether I agree with this argument (although I don't agree with the premise of not punching down in comedy in the first place), but you are purposely mischaracterizing what he says just to push your agenda.",-0.191,0.079,0.829,0.092

When he discusses gender and sexuality, he does it from the perspective of a straight cis male, meaning he absolutely can punch down. He nearly got the point when talking about white gay people specifically, saying some of them pretend to not be gay when they need their whiteness for something.

That's why I want the dialogue to continue.

As for Rowling, it seems she's tied herself to a particular branch of feminism that is less ""pro women"" and more ""anti-patriarchy."" That's problematic for all kinds of reasons, but through that lense, she could only conclude that trans women are patriarchal infiltrators. Of course, I'm depending on the sources that you provided to come to that conclusion. All that I know about Rowling is that she wrote the Harry Potter books, is rich as hell, and has given a lot of her wealth to charity. I've never read any of her books, but I did watch the movies. 

So I can see why the trans community is upset that Dave carefully and deliberately aligned himself as a feminist, then an ally of Rowling, and then a TERF. And I appreciate the sources to help me gain a better understand of the context. 

That said, something that seems to have universal agreement is that the Twitter mob is wildly toxic. I'm cautious about what and where I post online because no matter what my position is, one group will tell me that I'm wrong and someone else will tell me that I didn't take it far enough.

"And here you are showing more effort to understand the critics than Chappelle is.

He chooses to only focus on a certain sliver of his critics and dismisses the rest.

He complains about being cancelled and that people aren't listening to him in his multi-million dollar special without listening to his critics.

And with that in mind and the context of the history transjokes you saw in in Lindsay Ellis video, can you understand why some of his critics might ""overreact"" and not really listen to the intricacies of what Chapelle is trying to say? And when he at the same time sides with JK Rowling, who supports so much hate.

Do you really feel like Chapelle has made a good faith effort in trying to understand where his critics are coming from?

I do agree that lots of his critics don't really try and see where Chapelle is coming from and what he is trying to say.

But I can't really blame them, they are met with, or see, so much hate and oppression every single day when it comes to trans.

I do blame Chapelle for not actually trying to understand his critics better. 

He is making millions of dollars.

He influences and shapes the understanding of this issue for millions of people.

He could be telling jokes about a million different things, why is it so important to tell jokes about trans people when it hurts so many of them? And not just one or two, so so so many jokes. Why is it so important to him to keep making those jokes?

Instead of engaging with his critics Chapelle focuses on a certain sliver of them, paints himself as a victim and complains about being ""cancelled"".

THAT kills discussion more than anything else going on here.

Chapelle has a much much more powerful position than some Twitter mob.

Now I wanna point out that the ""twitter mob"" is pretty awful. I am not really siding with them. But everyone knows that and Chapelle is powerful enough to deal with it any way he wants to.

However, Chappelle erred when he used those valid issues as excuses to express some very hurtful views.

It reminds me of Chris Rock's old bit about Black People versus N-'s.

The word woman is offensive to transwomen when the word woman is conflated with biology so women bend over backwards to erase biology from womanhood is to make them feel better.

The women who say 'actually I feel uncomfortable with this'...yeah, fuck them. The comfort and feelings of women don't matter. It's apparently our job as women to be pleasing and inoffensive to everyone and to ask for no consideration as to our feelings on the matter.

Discrimination {edit: based on ethnicity} seems to be accepted matter-of-factly; it's something that's been a part of life for millennia. Jokes can be made about it and arguments from many perspectives can be shared openly; who amongst us has complained about his use of the word nigger?

There are a lot of complicates feelings about this movie, and I think part of it because the creator is telling a very specific story that only a small group of people can relate too, and it deals with such heavy themes.

And you're also right about the Netflix employee, but incorporating her into this conversation brings in something for both of you. She in fact was one of the few who weren't just demanding to speak to the manager. 

The employee was fired for leaking data, not just because she protested the special. But [she was also apparently both black and pregnant](https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/15/22728337/netflix-fires-organizer-trans-employee-walkout-dave-chappelle), so they fired a black employee for actually taking some action. Contrast that to the others who seem to think they're going to get heard just because they yell very loudly.

And they were able to get rid of someone who was about to go on maternity leave. That's just a win/win situation for Netflix and it shouldn't get lost in this arguing back and forth about Chappelle. I support data leakers like 100% of the time and I hope she gets her job back, but above and beyond that, Netflix's motives are very suspect here.

Also I just realized you might be talking about a different employee. They had [suspended a few employees for attending a meeting without permission but reinstated them](https://variety.com/2021/film/news/netflix-dave-chapelle-reinstates-employees-1235087777/). They weren't fired.

It was a lesbian house, and these girls felt safe there. Ive always been open minded, so I pretty much assumed it was best.

So I was pretty ra ra go go. It took a lot of time for me to realize these girls had been traumatized and the people who were supposed to be healing them gave them some wierd idea that they needed a penis to escape the abuse.

Homeostasis. Do you know what that is? Its when You get healed. Its the panicle of human health. It means you are baseline, you do well in hot or cold, walking or sitting standing still.

Its the baseline drs are working from. So telling someone they need to change their body rather then move forward is medical malpractice, and its being done to gays and lesbians, kids who like the wrong color, or express themselves different.

Are there some bad actors in there? Hell yes, thats how I started questioning it all. When women act just like the men who abuse are in the abuse centres for women and they all have something in common..

"The human brain hasnt changed much from when we were still living in small semi-nomadic gatherer-hunter bands.  We can only effectively balance and process somewhere in the neighborhood of 100 relationships.  Obviously we can conceptualize larger numbers of people and can on a conscious level contextualize our experiences accordingly, but on an immediate level we feel like **everyone** either hates or loves something if we have direct evidence of about 100 people being mad or happy about it.  Twitter bubbles exploit this evolutionary reality of human psychology by making it seem like their outrage cycles have way more gravity than they actually do.  And the platform exploits this by using it to drive engagement.  If your brain is telling you everyone in the world is concerned about something then you need to participate in the conversation.

But the reality is nobody cares.  Breathe, pull the lens back, and pay attention to what people are actually doing in their daily lives.  Outside of particularly infected areas of a few cities most people arent participating in the culture war.  They care more about the things that materially affect their lives.

Example: I just got married.  Our honeymoon was a long roadtrip through New England.  The first leg after the ceremony was from NYC to Vermont.  I routed that leg to be particularly scenic so that day had zero interstate miles.  Once we got off the Taconic Parkway it was all surface streets running through town centers, in front of peoples houses, etc.  That entire day we saw two small Black Lives Matter signs, one Trump 2024 sign, no trans stuff, and no thin blue line flags.  And while we were in Vermont the one political discussion I overheard was between a regular customer (obviously a generations deep rural VT yankee) at a coffee shop and the middle aged lesbian working the counter.

"I did some math. We only have partial information, so I could be way off! But this paragraph caught my eye, I think we can put some things together with all the numbers we were given in that article.

&gt;The company also evaluates its programs by efficiency, which balances a shows reach with its price-tag. On that scale, Chappelles special scored 0.8  less than the break-even score of 1. By comparison, Burnhams Inside scored 2.8.

So my assumption is that ""balances a shows reach with its price-tag"" can be defined as cost-per-viewer. Onwards!

    Dave Chappelle's ""Closer"":
    Cost: $24,100,000
    Viewers: 10,000,000
    Cost per Viewer: $2.41
    Efficiency: 0.8

This means that the cost-per-viewer at Netflix's break-even score of 1 would be $1.93 per viewer. ""Inside"" has an efficiency score of 2.8. That means its' cost-per-viewer is $0.69 (nice).

    Bo Burnham's ""Inside"":
    Cost: $3,900,000
    **Viewers: 5,652,174**
    Cost per Viewer: $0.69
    Efficiency: 2.8

So, who knows what the timelines are (as you said, ""Inside"" had legs and only started trending two weeks after its release) or if repeat-viewings factor into efficiency, but I would imagine ""reach"" would be looking at unique viewers.

"It all started with a thread about John Brown and how killing literal 18th century slave owners was cool and good. Reddit admins took offense to this, and demanded chapo mods ban people calling for violence against literal 18th century slave owners. Chapo mods refused. Reddit admins quarantined the sub and removed several of the mods. Aside from promoting violence against literal 18th century slave owners, brigading was listed as a reason for quarantine. To be fair chapo did regularly brigade /r/dogswithjobs, but not any other subs really.

A plan was laid out by reddit admins for chapo to get back in the good graces of the site and come out of quarantine, and this was presented to the users of chapo. The users decided that being quarantined was good because quarantined subs don't have ads on them and therefore don't support reddit monetarily. They also decided that it would be really funny to get banned on purpose, as a joke. It became a meme to call for ""debating"" slave owners and Nazis. Chapo mods (including new mods installed by reddit admins to replace the removed mods) more or less tried to enforce sitewide rules and follow the plan which would lead to chapo eventually being unquarantined. The userbase more or less ignored these rules and continued on as usual. 

Chapo was finally banned on the same day as /r/the_donald and many right wing hate subs. The users decided it was a fair trade, and went down celebrating and posting ><U+0080>><U+0080>><U+0080>><U+0080>><U+0080>. The actual Chapo Trap House podcast also celebrated because they hated the sub and the sub mostly hated them. Thousands of ban evasion subs were created, mostly to fuck with reddit admins. Hundreds were banned on the first day. /r/chapotraphouse2 and /r/chapotraphouse3 were banned for being ban evasion subs, despite genuinely being independent subs with their own separate userbases who didn't even like /r/chapotraphouse (/r/chapotraphouse2 was a sub about Garfield the Cat memes). Some of the userbase left for reddit alternative [raddle.me](https://raddle.me/). Many went to subs like /r/stupidpol, /r/dankleft, /r/FULLCOMMUNISM, and /r/COMPLETEANARCHY",-0.985,0.103,0.724,0.172

"Whats scary is people do this because they want to. I had a friend who founded/ran a clan that got really popular in a video game he liked. He's a really good guy and all he wanted was to bring a community together and another clan, one that was known for being toxic and competitive for some reason decided to target his clan. I suspect it was because he was gaining some good traction to being the top clan and they lost some members to him because he treated people with respect and expected his members to do the same. 

Using these tactics described, the other clan dismantled the discord, every chat they tried to start, this other clan would just troll, but on the level where its harassment. Eventually it turned out one of my friend's inner circle was sneaking fake accounts into guild permissions and was letting that toxic guild have access. It was weird, dramatic and friendships ended.

You know, this is an interesting thing, and I think it's worth highlighting. Because the older people who are part of the discourse, both in politics and other marginalized groups, deserve some recognition. 

Why?

I think a lot of us whose beliefs, identities, whatever, have been denigrated or smeared by large portions of society at large have all had to struggle at some point with the idea that in those things, we're alone, we're crazy, we're immature or foolish, etc. It's a way of socially conditioning people that works almost as much by osmosis as it does intentional propaganda or manipulation. 

I've had this experience with a lot of things in life, political and personal. It amounts to a kind of social gaslighting, especially if you don't have people who are at least allies close to you in real life. 

One of the best things the internet has done for humanity is enabling people in that position to talk to each other and see that we're not alone, we're not crazy, we're not wrong for not ""growing out of"" our beliefs or what have you. 

But even then, it can seem like these connections only exist because of the internet, and that without it, we'd be just as illegitimate as we're told we are. 

That's why seeing older folks who share things I have had that gaslighting type experience over is always inspiring to me. Whether that be the 80 year old leftist, the 70 year old thru hiker, the 90 year old motorcyclist, the elderly LGBT person, whatever.  These people walked before us younger folks, often bearing the brunt of much sharper repression and much more vicious disregard, smears, and cruelty, and they made it. That means we can make it too. 

When it comes to antiwork, whatever that means- to me, simply the recognition that subservience to waged labor should not be the focus of our lives, rather than some argument against ""work"" as a concept- I think that's desperately needed in a culture that insists such views are simply a juvenile refusal to accept the reality we live in. 

Both fascists and neoliberals/status quo types lose the narrative war when radicals and others can stand stoic and assured in their beliefs, goals and identities, supported by each other and therefore not vulnerable to letting the propaganda of the opposition rattle them. So props to the older folks here and everywhere else like it who have retained their differences and not been beaten down over time, because even in our hyperalienated society, their mere existence tells the rest of us we can make it.",-0.832,0.083,0.821,0.096

Lie flat isn't just against the 40 hour work week that is now standard in law in China, it's against the entire concept of multiple jobs, working as hard as you can constantly, and even raising your social status.

Also, most people have been enculturated to believe that discussing policy is in itself an aggressive, antisocial behavior, and the past few years of our media doesn't refute that belief - so that's where the request/re-labeling of this as a 'no politics' sub might be coming from....   


Personally, I don't fuss with labels much anymore. I've lived under authoritarian regimes, communism, socialist democracies, capitalist democracies, and the connection between their self-labeling, policies, and societal outcomes gets really blurry in every case. When entering a new country, I look at very different things than their proclaimed identity.  


Things that AREN'T easily concealed are issues that this sub seems to highlight fantastically, such as: the working conditions that the culture as a whole thinks is acceptable for its least privileged members - their minorities, poor, elderly, disabled, immigrants, or 'outsiders'; the resources they invest in their children, public works, and land; the justice that can be expected by the weak vs the strong; class mobility; access to education and medical services; how to navigate an unjust institution, etc.   


I love that people on this subreddit are rejecting 'work as an inherent virtue' and 'affluence equals value' and the mythology that everyone can 'make it big if they just work hard enough'. Not saying that labels are all bad, just that sometimes academic terms can distract from the core problems.

"Fascinating history, thank you for educating me. But the labor movement has not made significant reforms for decades. It's currently weaker than at any time in history, with record low union participation, three decades of wage stagnation, I'm sure you're aware of the metrics. I don't see how you can unify a broad labor movement by focusing on the differences of the people within that movement. If I was an oligarch, I'd be happy if white workers and workers of color saw themselves as somehow at odds with one another. Even if that's not the intent of those engaged in identity politics, that's how it's perceived by half of the working class, which ensures the marginalization of all of us, no matter how we identify.",0.794,0.11,0.822,0.067

In my opinion, there is only one division that needs to be stressed in this country: that of the multiracial working class against the oligarchs. Any other division dooms workers.

A lot of activism weakens itself by insisting that minority groups are being ""divisive"" by needing to be also respected, defended, and occasionally prioritized.

They insist they'll just get around to worrying about the parts of the movement that're relevant to trans or black issues....later. 

Eventually. Maybe. 

Because ""everyone"" has to accomplish more *important* work first.

Then they wonder why the subgroups who're viewed/treated as acceptable collateral damage lose faith in empty, pretty words about working towards a better future for everyone, become resentful, and stop showing up.

"This is a mischaracterization, since comedians are always looking for unique angles to approach controversial issues.

"Being canceled doesn't mean what 99% of people talking about it means  anymore.  Losing a small amount of celebrity or being criticized for an act because of the content of that act is not being canceled.  People suggesting that the performance of someone will affect their spending behaviors at that same venue is not canceling someone.  Chapelle has made a decision to continue this nonsense because it makes him money.  So ""being canceled"" for marketing purposes means offending people and having stupid opinions and profiting from it, while simultaneously being censured by some subset of people.  There's plenty of Joe Roganites and older dudes to defend him and keep him going.

In the end there wasn't anything unique in what he said.  He's an aging and increasingly irrelevant comedian like Seinfeld and their attitudes toward how everyone should feel about them and their work is pretty much the same- weirdly arrogant and vapid.  I watched the show and until I came to reddit my overall thoughts were that it was lame as shit, and I missed old Chapelle.

"Generating controversy intentionally is age old marketing, I would distinguish it from ""Attempting to be canceled"", but I see your point. 

While I disagree with the end conclusion that he is a cast aside performer at this point, I do agree that Chapelle's earlier work was ""better"" and at times he leans on his laurels.

That said, prime Chapelle was a talented performer coming into a changing era, ripe for commentary, within a new time for comedy and at the peak of Comedy Central. It will be a high standard for nearly anyone to match.",0.94,0.163,0.806,0.031
"My main disappointment with Chapelle was his reasons for quitting comedy on his original program and everyone's hope for him going forward.

Which is... why he quit his original show.. he was being asked to do that.",0.739,0.171,0.754,0.075
"But that also ties to the difference about comedy. ""Punching up/down"" is bullshit. Comedy punches whoever needs to be punched at that point in time.

Shit, I'm saying it as jokes, but even I'm doing this knowing damn well you're probably going to kill me for defying you.""

Considering right now, too many people are looking at comedy as ""...no, no, don't you DARE make fun of me, that's just MEAN to make fun of me. You want to make fun of people? Make fun of THEM all you want. It's okay, they're EVIL so they DESERVE to be made fun of for it!""...newsflash. *You have a LOT of harsh truths you NEED to be told.*",0.172,0.24,0.553,0.207

Shit, you're even flat-out saying it because your statement could be boiled down to ""Chappelle was funny when he made fun of people I don't like, but now he's making fun of me and that's not FAIR!""

"I understand that trans people suffer, which I feel really sorry for. But fundamentally I do not understand where their expectations come from.

They do deserve civil rights in that the government has no say in their body choices. After that however, it's like they expect other people and institutions to adjust to THEM.

I'm a sperg. Straight up, I don't even know if Asperger's is real. I doubt it constantly and always have. Certainly don't expect to fit in or be ""normal."" It's a lost cause and better to accept it.

Trans people have to at least doubt what is going on in their minds enough to give the normies leeway. Like are you SURE it is worth getting people cancelled for not believing in your identity?

What is with this recent obsession in the LGBTQ community with being ""normal?"" What's wrong with being different? Having a cool subculture? Connecting with other not-normal people? We used to have all sorts of cool subcultures and being weird was valued in the US.

Why do they expect boomers to suddenly accept, without protest, that people can swap around penises and vaginas like it's no big deal? Why not just give them time to adjust and absorb this massive change to human civilization?

"Im coming in quite late with a reply but as I see it, a core issue is the violence perpetrated against transgender people. In particular black transgender women are one of the most abused groups of people in the country. Its also extremely common for transgender people to be shunned by their families and communities at a young age, resulting in being homeless and impoverished. It can be very challenging to get a job when those in power are afraid or disgusted or even just confused by your appearance, keeping those people in poverty.

Its not JUST about not believing in their identity; its about how disrespectful, dangerous, degrading, dehumanizing some people are when they do not believe. And even if Dave Chappelle was not any of those things, a lot of people listen to him. And hes not up there telling fart jokes, hes like philosophizing.  

And I think they could have a VERY cool subculture& if enough of them had power to build a life. 

So while perhaps it can be really annoying or outrageous to see trans people who are somewhat wealthy or privileged get really upset and cancelly at just jokes or words, I do think that we have to change the culture to gain safety and stability for those without so much privilege. And i do think we should do it quickly. Peoples lives are at stake.

"Here's what I think happened to Daphne Dorman:

She was struggling to make it as a trans comedian.

She was struggling with mental health issues.

Dave Chappelle got himself in trouble for making previous homophobic and transphobic comments, so in order to do damage control, he hired a transgender comedian to open for him. (Not an unusual move for celebrities with professional consultants managing their image.)

Dave continues with his transphobic rhetoric.

Daphne tolerates his bullshit because she needs a job but it doesn't help her mental health. After all, we have to keep in mind this was the break of a lifetime for her. She probably would have tolerated all kinds of things for the opportunity to open for a world famous comedian.

The LGBTQ community gets sick of Dave Chappelle's repeated attacks and becomes upset. Daphne feels compelled to defend Dave Chappelle and receives backlash for it.

Now Daphne is forced to fight with her own community while dealing with a transphobic boss and mental health issues. All the while, I'm sure she's also trying to cope with the scrutiny that comes with trying to make it in Hollywood. I'm also not convinced her family was very supportive.

Daphne commits suicide.

Dave Chappelle honors her memory by making fun of her community and calling her genitals fake meat.

Dave gets paid well and receives lots of media attention for his controversial statements. He is still alive. He is able to make his opinions known despite his assertion he's been canceled. In fact, he enjoys one of the largest platforms in the entire world from which to spew his hate.

Daphne's family shows more interest in maintaining a relationship with a rich and famous celebrity than they do defending the trans community. They side with Dave.

As for Daphne, well, no one can ask her for her version of events because she's dead.

No official cause of suicide was ever determined. Assertions she killed herself due to ""bullying on Twitter"" are Dave's assertions with no hard proof whatsoever.

It's not known if she committed suicide because of comments on Twitter or if she committed suicide because of transphobia from Dave Chappelle or if she committed suicide for some completely unrelated reason that we will never know about. 

Personally, I find it hard to believe a trans stand-up comedian, who I'm sure has stared down her fair share of hecklers, would become so upset over a few mild comments on Twitter that she would kill herself. 

It makes more  sense that her suicide is the result of ongoing anguish in her day-to-day life as a result of dealing with transphobia both from the public and from her employer.

I also would tend to not view one wacky theory as a discrediting factor, especially if the positor is open to rebuttal.

I am not an expert in Bailey specifically, I just know of him from the internet nonsense, which centers on discrediting him in his area of expertise (psychology) because of his book on trans women, which to my knowledge has not been discredited by anyone who isn't an activist.

I'm not a huge fan of the idea of seeing homosexuality as something that is caused by parasites (born this way all the way), but I do believe in the academic process. You air the dumb theory, present your evidence, then another person contradicts with a new theory.

This [NPR review](https://www.npr.org/2021/10/05/1043435919/dave-chappelle-new-netflix-special-the-closer-review) has been getting a lot of deserved shit, but I do agree with parts of it. Dave *does* often treat oppression as a zero-sum game. He says that DaBaby was ""cancelled"" for homophobic remarks, but not for killing someone. To him, it's a clear sign of how the gay rights movement has been so successful while the black rights movement hasn't, because people in charge will do whatever it takes to avoid pissing off LGBT activists.

This take is dumb for a lot of reasons. First of all, DaBaby [shot someone in self-defense](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DaBaby#Huntersville,_North_Carolina_shooting), which is hardly a reason to ""cancel"" someone. Also, I feel like he's 
cherry-picking examples. (I wonder what ""Papa John"" Schnatter though about that bit...) And I'd argue that one of the reasons the LGBT rights movement had such quick success was because because they built off the victories of the Civil Rights movement.

EDIT: Another thing, if Dave's gonna argue that we shouldn't judge Kevin Hart for offensive things he said in the past, I feel like he *probably* shouldn't give feminists a pile of shit for excluding Sojourner Truth in the 1860s. 

That being said, most of it was terrific. He had some great lines. (""Someone told me, ""Dave, they's after you"", and I said... ""How many they's?""). And the section about Daphne was one of his best and most poignant. The countless people calling him transphobic are completely missing the point. It was a great overall message for the special. Lastly, (spoiler alert): &gt;!Daphne's social media accounts are still active. I really wish she could see [how many loving, positive comments she's received](https://twitter.com/DaphneDorman/status/1166937728681791488)!&lt;",0.995,0.228,0.672,0.1

His story telling is the best in the business as far as I'm concerned - always right on point, pared down, brilliantly  constructed, with a whip crack ending.  The guy is (as he implied) maybe the greatest standup of all time.  And because he's as smart as he is, he's moving on from this well plowed field to find new ground.",0.992,0.318,0.682,0
"The special was great. The comparison to racial ""transition"" vs. gender - and how he understands women would be pissed off (Caitlyn Jenner, etc.) was so great. I've been waiting for someone with a massive platform like him to come out and say it, and in such a direct way. I can't think of a writer, scholar, researcher, theorist or doctor - or whoever else we ""trust"" to talk about Trans issues - actually just saying out loud what he did. But tons of regular people are thinking it! This is why we need comedians! (PS Follow OliLondon for an extremely hilarious/potentially disturbing?? real-life example of this). 

The only thing I didn't particularly enjoy was his take on bathrooms. I get it, he's coming from a male perspective, so it kind of leaves out a big chunk of the debate... but I have to remind myself he's not here to represent every side of the argument, he's here to give his take and explain his point of view in an entertaining way. 

Something the special, and the debate surrounding it, made me think about is that before the internet gave everyone a platform, comedians were some of the only high profile people who were skewering hot button issues and pushing the envelope for the masses. Making us think, laugh, get grossed out, etc. The internet/activist/woke explosion absolutely zapped all of the entertainment and humor factor out of this type of thing. Absolute bores were suddenly given huge platforms through viral videos, tweets, etc., opining on these topics in a strident, over-educated, preachy manner. This is like catnip to certain people and a huge turnoff to others (I'm in the turn off camp myself). Maybe if you had to express yourself in a way that is entertaining enough that someone would pay to sit in a theater for an hour and listen to you vs. any old person being able to parrot the same talking points on twitter, YouTube, etc., we would already be in a place where we could talk about this stuff in a sane way?

"&gt; I have to remind myself he's not here to represent every side of the argument, he's here to give his take and explain his point of view in an entertaining way.

To be fair, that's what most people do. They present their take on something and don't care about other sides, or just pay it lip service. Just today, the erudite scholars of Jezebel [published yet another anti-Chappelle opinion piece](https://jezebel.com/dave-chappelle-is-happy-to-be-canceled-1847839886). The author flat-out said, ""No one's ever permanently canceled."" I guess the author didn't watch the special? &gt;!Killing yourself is pretty fucking permanent.

I still have trouble believing a days-long pile-on by the Permanently Online Twitter Brigade didn't play at least a small part in the decision.)!&lt; These writers aren't paid to talk about the psychological toll of pile-ons and other mean girl bullshit. They're paid to be snarky and to give their fellow misandrists/misanthropes fodder to feel superior to other men. (It's telling that, instead of fully retracting or otherwise disowning [this oh so incisive hot take](https://jezebel.com/is-the-uva-rape-story-a-gigantic-hoax-asks-idiot-1665233387), they just published a few links and washed their hands of the whole thing.)

Just a thought.

Communication is difficult. It doesn't help that so few people communicate *why* they're communicating. Just looking to blow off steam? Trying to find like-minded people? Talking shit 'cause you're drunk? So many problems of ours could be solved if we knew *why* people are communicating. Even being paid to communicate is weird. Some people are just trying to entertain. Others are trying to change the world. In the end, I'd argue the people paying attention to somebody are a reflection of that person.

"The philosopher Jean-Franois Lyotard, best known for his prescient analysis in The Postmodern Condition of how public discourse discards the categories of true/false and just/unjust in favor of valuing the mere fact that something is being communicated, examined the tension between experience and argument in a different way.

Instead of defining freedom of expression as guaranteeing the robust debate from which the truth emerges, Lyotard focused on the asymmetry of different positions when personal experience is challenged by abstract arguments. His extreme example was Holocaust denial, where invidious but often well-publicized cranks confronted survivors with the absurd challenge to produce incontrovertible eyewitness evidence of their experience of the killing machines set up by the Nazis to exterminate the Jews of Europe. Not only was such evidence unavailable, but **it also challenged the Jewish survivors to produce evidence of their own legitimacy in a discourse that had systematically denied their humanity.**

Lyotard shifted attention away from the content of free speech to the way certain topics restrict speech as a public good. Some things are unmentionable and undebatable, but not because they offend the sensibilities of the sheltered young. **Some topics, such as claims that some human beings are by definition inferior to others, or illegal or unworthy of legal standing, are not open to debate because such people cannot debate them on the same terms.** - Ulrich Baer, *What Snowflakes Get Right*",-0.88,0.111,0.752,0.137

Even worse, he laid the sins of racist gay white men at the feet of trans women, which feeds into the ""predatory trans women"" narrative that gets us killed (particularly trans women of color, who he kind of pretend don't exist).

Seriously, there's no way to do that without being either malicious, or willfully ignorant to the point there's no functional difference from malice. 

This is way less nuanced than we'd like to believe.

"I know this special has caused a lot of pain in our community, and as a trans guy, I'm not a fan of his jokes, even if I'm not the explicit target for most of them. That being said, he's just a comedian, not the president of our country. When a comedian says something, I expect it to be tangentially related to the truth, at best. And I certainly would not take anything they say as education, at least not without a hefty dose of evidence to support it. Two, there is also a difference between inciting violence explicitly and making fun of a group of people. People who are trans are more likely to experience homelessness, violence, poverty, etc., but when we as a community label everything that hurts our feelings or we disagree with as violence, it starts to wear on other people, leaving them feeling like they are walking on eggshells around us. I think we, as a community, can distinguish between actual violence and language we don't appreciate. 

  
If anything, I would say his special has been helpful to me personally, because it's given me an in to talk about trans issues with my brother-in-law, who's even older than I am (I'm pushing 40). He communicates in a very stereotypical guy way, i.e., through mocking and insulting the people he loves. We've had some decent conversations around why trans people are hurt by his jokes, Dave's point around our community being too sensitive, and how the relative scarcity of trans people means that most folks are only exposed to trans issues online, where nuance is very hard to come by. I think that's a huge part of the problem, honestly, because most cis people's sole experience with trans people is online, so they don't know any trans people personally to help bridge the gap between the extremes they get online.",-0.872,0.124,0.738,0.137

There absolutely was a time, but that time has clearly passed. Because I regularly perform digital self harm, I watched the latest special.

I had a ~~black~~ trans friend and they said I'm not."" He says the trans community needs to stop punching his community, but the only one getting punched in his stories is him.

"We can debate how influential Dave Chappelle is, or JK Rowling, but I still don't agree with censorship. I am concerned by the fact that rather than engage with people who don't share our opinions, some trans people would rather try to shut them up. There are too many people on this planet to just blacklist or cancel everyone that doesn't agree with every position you take. And yes that includes trans issues. We have to be able to see shades of gray and act accordingly. There is an increasingly long list of folks who were once thought of as thoughtful, intelligent, insightful, or otherwise complex and fully realized human beings, only for them to be labeled a transphobe for taking a position counter to the most extreme activist position. And once they are labeled a transphobe, all nuance goes out the window, as does their body of work. Most of us are adults, and we should be able to critically engage with Chappelle, Rowling, or whoever, with measured, thoughtful responses, even if they don't give us the same respect.   


The other issue I see is that folks say that Netflix should remove his special because it spreads transphobia, and that will make it more dangerous for trans people. I can follow the logic, but I think it's far too simplistic when applied to Dave Chappelle, or really any individual contributor. His voice is one among many comedians, among many entertainers and content providers. No one is getting all of their information about trans people from Dave Chappelle. Further, because we live in a country that positions freedom of speech as a core tenet of our society (many of the first settlements in America were folks from religious communities who were ostracized in their countries of origin), a lot of people get really triggered when they perceive they are being censored. And rather than open their minds to different ideas, they close themselves off even more. I don't see insisting Netflix remove the special accomplishes anything for trans people other than stirring up resentment toward our community and reinforcing the perception that trans people don't have a thick enough skin to handle dissenting opinions.",0.982,0.121,0.823,0.056

There is a pathway that leads to genocide. When we see societies starting to walk down that path, *we absolutely need to speak up about it.* And we see it with more than just trans people.

I feel like theres plenty of ways to adequately express how bad things are without bringing the Holocaust and all the suffering it wrought into the mix.

The way I was brought up and taught about the Holocaust spared no expenses when it came to detailing the horrors of the Holocaust, maybe even doing so with as much of the horrible details as possible in order to drive home just how bad it was among the youth. Either way, it absolutely horrifies me, and thats more than half a century after it happened. Living through it goes beyond what most people living in modern society can imagine. 

I can see your comparison making sense, youre absolutely right about history (to an extent, and hopefully never all the way) repeating itself, and its terrifying.

Jokes at the expense of marginalized groups ABSOLUTELY metastasize into violence against those people. Dave Chapelle understands this when it comes to his own life experiences. Either hes gone full myopic extreme-wealth-goggles, or he is **pretending** (for comfort, ego, and profit) not to understand this, after decades of privately and publicly processing how his jokes about blackness were appropriated by violent racists. 

It is severely hypocritical, willfully ignorant, and absolutely infuriating. And it is dangerous for the people hes degrading and marginalizing to his millions of fans.

"I really dont like seeing him everywhere I turn on Reddit lately and my comments are starting to reflect that. Source on the Catholics:

https://catholicherald.co.uk/ch/dave-chappelle-and-the-terf-wars/

He walked away from a third season of Chapelles Show in 2004 because he felt uncomfortable with white people laughing too hard at racist stereotypes, like hes contributing to racism, and I respected and understood that.

17 years later, hes overjoyed to take a fat check from Netflix and will double and triple down on punching down at a marginalized community. Meanwhile, do you know whos coming into transgender communities to defend him? White dudebros that would yell Wayne Brady, bitch! fifteen years ago without sparing a thought to the problems facing the Black community in America as they did so.

Everyone is shouting so loud about how we cant cancel Dave Chapelle that theyre drowning out the voices of transgender people hes damaging. Theyre silencing us. I would be happiest if we never heard from him again, but hes adamantly riding the spotlight on this to renew his commitment of hatred towards LBGTQ+ people, regardless of ethnicity.",-0.731,0.079,0.808,0.113

Ours is that no jokes were told, no comedy was performed, and that it became a rally against tolerance and the LBGTQ+ community performed to a receptive audience in Detroit. Even just the stupid impossible burger joke taken out of context - its saying that trans women can never be real women, to a national audience of millions, and somehow, Dave Chapelle is the victim in all of this. Is it any wonder were upset?

If you wanna tell jokes about trans people, make fun of what we do or our situation. Everyone loves a good trans girls and cat ears joke.

Ok. What narratives, why is bad and why do we lose them? Like we still have stories even if we dont believe them. An odyssey is still used as a metaphor for struggle. David vs Goliath is still used as a metaphor for an underdog vanquishing an obstacle.

"Peterson's whole debate / discussion tactic is a form of the motte-and-bailey. He tries to link two subjects by mentioning them close to each other, but never says that one causes the other. One of these subjects will be the topic, the other will be some ""basic fact"" that can't be argued. By getting everyone on board with Idea #2 being uncontroversially true, the connection he's drawing between the subjects is also implied to be true. The moment anyone calls him on that or asks for clarification--""Are you implying that...""--he shifts to ""I am being persecuted, you're strawmanning me, you're putting words in my mouth."" 

For example, you and I are talking about the gender pay gap. Apropos fucking nothing, I pose this statement and question: ""Well, there are physiological, biological differences between the sexes. Men are, on average, stronger than women. That's just a scientific fact. We can agree on that, right?""

Of course you can agree. It'd be silly to deny that. ""But what does it have to do with the gender pay gap,"" you ask. Well, I didn't say it does. I was just mentioning a fact. There are differences between the sexes, and we can agree there.

My fans will then pick up on my implication: the pay gap isn't the result of women being paid less because of sexism, but rather men being more suited for these better-paying jobs. Women simply can't perform or, by virtue of their *feminine brains*, don't want those jobs. There is no trend of women being hired for lesser positions or denied promotions in favor of men, there are no forces keeping them from training for better paying jobs, the old boy's club doesn't exist. It's just women not being cut out for the well-paying work.

But I won't admit that, and I will deny any attempt by you to figure out why I brought this statement into play or what my intentions or implications were.

------

He didn't make the distinction between angry twitter accounts and the LGTBQ community in general. In fact, he goes out of his way to address the entire LGBTQ community explicitly. He said that they act like minorities until they need to act white around black people. He based this off of one bad experience he had with them. He joked how he had to look out for trans people. He said 'Trans people make up words to win arguments'. 


----

He used a huge platform to lie about the trans community is punching down.

In his last special, he said JK Rowling was cancelled for stating a biological fact.

First, she wasn't cancelled. she's still with her publisher, still publishing books, with trans characters who are murderers.

If by cancelled, he means that people were mean to her on twitter. The biggest controversy didn't come out until she lied about someone's contract being renewed for purposely not referring to people by their chosen pronoun. Not making a mistake, but going out her way to be rude to people she interacts with. JK Rowling said she was fired for her opinions.

Twitter uses have 280 characters. Chappelle has a long-form format on one of the biggest platforms on the world, and he's using it to lie about the LGBTQ community. That's what punching down means.

But to Chappelle, punching down on him is critiquing his demand to use a homophobic slur, the F word. Something he never got cancelled for. Chappelle can just not go on twitter if he doesn't want to hear about the people he makes upset, but that's not good enough for him.

----

He complained that the LGBTQ community is preventing him to from going white people. That he had them on the ropes before the LGBTQ community. It's Dave who keeps on dedicating his specials to them. When his last special was released there were no articles being written about his beef with them, no social media trends. And then he dedicated nearly his whole special to them. 

And if he wants to get conspiratorial about white people, race, and sexuality issues, look at what they did in India and the Philippines. They did a ton to demonize homosexuality in those areas. They always do. Like the Caste system in India and apartheid in South Africa, they are always pitting minority groups against each other so that they won't focus on their oppressor. 

And I don't see how this could be any more fucking glaring that the anti-gay people and anti-trans people are the same ones who are anti-BLM. 

----

He also complained that Dababy got cancelled for being homophobic but not for murder. First, it's always easy for celebraties for attacking minorities than for attacking individuals. The CEO of papa john got cancelled for using the N word. Roseanne got cancelled for telling a black person she looks like a monkey. Barbara Bush got away with running over someone. Chris Brown got away with beating Rihanna. 

But most of this is out of the hands of the LGBTQ community. 

Futhermore, social media backlash isn't a strong indicator of the extent to which systemic racism and homophobia is being addressed in our society. There's a still record high killings of trans people. Police and still largely murder black people and face no legal repercussions. 

-----

He complained 'to what extent am I obligated to participate in your self image'. You have none Chappelle, but to what extent are they obligated to indulge in the idea that you are beyond criticism. 


----

He complained about trans people using made up words to win arguments, when it was TERFs who coined that term specifically to identify themselves as those who exclude trans people from their efforts. 

Also, the majority of the terms that were coined for identifying phenomena regarding the marginalization of minorities came from the racial equality movement. It's mostly the anti-BLM people who criticize people for using terms like microaggressions. 


----

He blamed the LGBTQ community for taking away Kevin Hart's childhood dream of hosting the Oscars. 

First off, his old jokes were hurtful. Don Lemon did a great job of explaining why. 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBNyDdpKcbo

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCDTEfw3hNY

And Kevin Hart later acknowledges at much, saying that he has grown since. 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwG7rFwwi10

But the issue is that he was adamant in not addressing it twice. But he never apologized the first time. Every interview he did about it, he defended himself

https://www.vulture.com/2019/01/kevin-hart-homophobic-tweets-apologies-ellen-degeneres.html

Btw, by his own usage of the terminology, Chappelle tried to 'cancel' Don Lemon

I don't think Chappelle was homophobic/transphobic in his initial specials. He had some cognitive biases which resulting in him saying some hurtful stuff. But his refusal to accept any criticism and the resulting backlash has resulted in a full blown fear -&gt; phobia of LGBTQ people besides 'the good ones' who are his friends. It's similar to a type of racism many white people have today; they believe in the idea of equality in general, but think the Black community are people hateful to white people when the kneel for the Anthem and criticize the police. They think Black people are misguided in how they address systemic racism, and I feel Chappelle feels similarly about how LGBTQ address systemic homophobia and transphobia. Chappelle specifically made comments about the sufferings of trans people, about unjust bathrooms laws. So It's hard to talk about this on the only major medium people have to discuss this; twitter; 160 characters. Most of the responses are 'you didn't watch the special. 


Chappelle wants full equality for LGBTQ people. But he didn't want them to address the very hurtful jokes made by Kevin Hart or the comments by JK Rowling. He doesn't want them to call out people for using sluts; he complained about not being able to use the F-word slur.  He also implied that the idea of the LGBTQ calling themselves 'my people' is racist, but at the end of the special used that exact phrase to refer to his fellow comedians. 'Stop punching down on my people'. 

He always tries to pit the LGBTQ community against the Black community. He complains about why is it easier for Bruce Jenner to change his gender than it was for Cassius Clay to change his name.

"People pretending Dave is a hack now is the natural progression of being okay with a comedian when he says x and it makes you laugh, but deciding he lost his touch the second he said something you personally find objectionable. It just goes to show that black pain is an acceptable form of comedy. Nobody gave a solitary fuck when he joked about R. Kelly abusing girls, and he wasn't just speaking truth to power. He was being a comedian and finding humour in something terrible. 

Chappelle also isn't saying he's **being** canceled, he said people have tried to cancel him. That's objectively true, but ya'll pretending no one has called for Netflix to remove his specials and stop working with him. That is absolutely a call for cancellation. Here's a pro-tip: if your reaction to a comedian's set goes beyond ""He's a dick"", the next step isn't to say it's unacceptable for that act to be made available on a service, it's to move on. 

Edit: for the sake of discussion and to have my own taste in comedy dissected and/or shit on my three favourite comedians are Norm Macdonald, Dave, and Patrice O'Neal. Three fearless guys whose take on anything is hilarious. To them absolutely nothing was an obstacle to being funny.

"His anger is with the fact that America is a country that has been struggling with race since its inception. A country built on the back of slavery. A country that has been through the civil rights movement, Martin Luther King, Malcolm X, Black Lives Matter& and black Americans are STILL treated like second class citizens in many contexts. The black community still suffers measurably from generational inequality and systemic inequality.

Meanwhile, the trans community has had incredible acceptance in recent years. Very suddenly it became taboo to question trans behaviour, misgender or dead-name someone. Public figures would face huge backlash for so much as questioning this new reality where gender is suddenly fluid and sex isnt determined by anatomy. 

If you cant see why that would make a black man who cares passionately about racial equality angry, then you need to take your blinkers off. 

To me it was crystal clear that Dave Chappelle does not have a problem with trans people, or gay people, or women. He is a man who is intimately familiar with the black communitys fight for equality, and he does not like what he sees in how these other communities have approached the same problem - and the difference in expectations and outcomes for them.",-0.712,0.094,0.795,0.11
"&gt;Public figures would face huge backlash for so much as questioning this new reality where gender is suddenly fluid and sex isnt determined by anatomy.

Yeah, and they also face backlash for racism. The CEO of Papa John's got backlash for using the N word. Kramer got backlash for using the N-word. But backlash on social media isn't an indicator of the extent systemic racism and homophobia is being dismantled in our society. The still record high killings of trans people. The police still largely get no legal repercussions for murdering black people. 


&gt;If you cant see why that would make a black man who cares passionately about racial equality angry, then you need to take your blinkers off.

You need to study about the history of white colonizers using sexuality to divert attention from themselves.  It's what the colonizers did in India and the Philippines, with massive demonization of homoesxuality, so that they would focus their hate on them rather than their oppressors. It's what they do. They pit minority groups against each other. They perfected it with the Caste system in India and Apartheid in South Africa.

So I can't imagine why it isn't so fucking obvious to Chappelle that the same people who are taking voting rights away from black people are the ones who are say trans rights have done too far.

Chappelle blamed their LGBTQ community for preventing him talking about white people, but he's the one who chose to dedicate a whole special for them. 

&gt;He is a man who is intimately familiar with the black communitys fight for equality, and he does not like what he sees in how these other communities have approached the same problem 

Yet he's parroting conservatives rhetoric against BLM, against the LGTBQ community. He said Trans people invented the term 'Terf'. It was actually Terms who coined the term and choice to call themselves that, but moving past that, the majority of the terminology coined for addressing systemic oppression against minorities came from the racial equality movement.

First off, sex is different from gender. Most trans people would agree with that. Thats why its become more common to say things like people who menstrate/people with a penis. Sex does not determine gender. And it still ignores the issue of intersex people AKa people born with sex features of men and women. 


Ofc there are people within the community who hold extreme beliefs and are jack offs, but equating everyone within the community to that is the same shit racist people do to the black community.  This few black people are violent and extreme when it comes to wanting rights, thus the civil rights movement/BLM is violent and extreme. Black people want too much. Which is something Martin Luther fucking King Jr addressed in his letter from a Birmingham jail, outlining that moderate white people would often say that black people wanted too much and they just had to be patient and wait for a better time to demand rights. Equating the entire movement to extremeism. And its pathetic that people will read all of that but fail to have the critical thinking and empathy to try to apply it to anything else. 

Second, what this argument sounds like to me is it was hard for us to have this thing so you have to go through the same thing, otherwise youre spoiled and lazy. Like what the absolute fuck. We shouldnt turn our eye to oppression just because a group is starting to see leaps and bounds in equality. That makes a person an oppressor. 

And as a black person? Fuck Dave chapelle. Fuck his logic. Ive met blacks people with this line of thought that they are the true victims and no one can complain about anything and they are self involved, selfish, and entitled. 

It is legal in parts of the US to kill a trans person if you freak out because you find out they are trans. Trans people have an insanely high level of suicide. Trans people also have a high rate of being straight up murdered. Its GOOD that our society is recognizing that. 

Dave called himself a TERF which means hes anti trans. Refusing to acknowledge peoples identity is in the same category as stripping a slaves identity and name. 

Dont speak for all black people as if you are woke enough to use that to tear down another group. Dont speak on their history while being obviously ignorant about a marginalized group. Dont use our history to critique how another group of people seek their equality. I refuse to be used as an example to tear other people down to fit a narrative or to justify peoples ignorance and hate. You dont get a trophy of wokeness for recognizing one groups plight. 

Youre transphobic and racist. Using black peoples history to tear another group down shows you only value a perfect victim narrative, you dont actually value black people.

"TL;DR IMO: He a bit confused but he got the spirit.

As a transperson, who watched all the specials and did their own research... he's not... Transphobic. He very clearly explains that he just has a unique view point because of his race. Which I get to some extent.

His claim that he's a TERF is both technically correct and technically incorrect. He's a TERF in that he believes Trans-Women shouldn't have the same rights/respect as Cis-Women. He's not a TERF in that he recognizes Transpeople are a prosecuted minority that deserve the same protections as racial minorities and homosexuals. He's not a TERF in that he still believes Transwomen are Women. He said that on his show. In his own words he ""gets"" that.

Most of his ""TERF""-ness is not differences in how he views existing law and how it should be reformed. But rather his cultural understanding and desires. And it's very easy for me and other Trans-People to argue that he doesn't get it. In terms of how he views trans culture, I genuinely believe he doesn't really 'get' us. And he doesn't really 'get' our place in the larger community by extension. And it's that's failure that is leading to all the hate. When he says we have his respect I believe him. But when he says he gets it... I keep thinking ""no he doesn't."" And honestly? I don't think any amount of cyber bullying is going to help him get it, either.

In his most recent special he talked about a Trans-Woman he had a professional relationship with. It was... a pretty okay bit. He REALLY walked the line a few times, getting a little too close to phobia and mis-information. But he always either found a way to make it clear he didn't actually believe something and that it was a punch-line or clarify why he had to get so close and that what happened was true, a true story, a quoted line. I felt the comedian on stage was a little too brash and harsh. But that Dave Chapelle wasn't a transphobe or hater off stage.

We can ask him to stop making jokes about it but... he won't. That's what he does. He built a career out of making jokes about societal problems and communities no one else would even acknowledge. It's like asking a bear to stop being large and intimidating.

The trans-issue, what it means to be trans, why we're trans, and what to do about it... Is an extremely difficult topic any way. and, personally, I think expecting Cis-People to understand what it's like being trans is too big of an ask. We have his respect, he agrees with our legal agenda, and if he would stop spreading mis-information about our culture, there's not much more we could ask of a celebrity.

And I think the concern the 'cancel' culture has, even is they haven't articulated it for them selves yet... Is they don't want Dave's show to unintentionally become and echo chamber for hate. Dave takes a ""blas"" approach to the trans issue. That approach often leaves the door open for ill-intended fans to come along and ""turn"" the community or the Celeb.

""We generally have the same debates about comedy over and over. Lets address those upfront: Art should be made without restriction. Free speech reigns supreme. Sometimes good art should make us uncomfortable, and sometimes bad people can make good art. Comedians, in particular, are going to punch up and down and side-to-side.  


  
Also true: Comedy is not above criticism, even if the most famous, wildly wealthy comedians will keep insulting those who question them. Its just laughs, right? Lighten up. All criticism is forestalled with this setup, in which when you object to anything a comedian says, youre the problem. Youre the one whos narrow-minded or brittle or humorless.  


  
Shut up, Dave Chappelle recalls telling a woman who had the gall to challenge his comedy, using a sexist slur and laughing at how witty he is, as if hes the first man to ever deliver such an original, funny line. Before I kill you and put you in the trunk. Aint nobody around here. The audience cheers, before Mr. Chappelle explains that he didnt in fact threaten the woman: I felt that way, but thats not what I said. I was more clever than that.  


  
Mr. Chappelle spends much of The Closer, his latest comedy special for Netflix, cleverly deflecting criticism. The set is a 72-minute display of the comedians own brittleness. The self-proclaimed GOAT (greatest of all time) of stand-up delivers five or six lucid moments of brilliance, surrounded by a joyless tirade of incoherent and seething rage, misogyny, homophobia and transphobia.  


  
If there is brilliance in The Closer, its that Mr. Chappelle makes obvious but elegant rhetorical moves that frame any objections to his work as unreasonable. Hes just being brutally honest. Hes just saying the quiet part out loud. Hes just stating facts. Hes just making us think. But when an entire comedy set is designed as a series of strategic moves to say whatever you want and insulate yourself from valid criticism, Im not sure youre really making comedy.  


  
Throughout the special, Mr. Chappelle is singularly fixated on the L.G.B.T.Q. community, as he has been in recent years. He reaches for every low-hanging piece of fruit and munches on it gratuitously. Many of Mr. Chappelles rants are extraordinarily dated, the kind of comedy you might expect from a conservative boomer, agog at the idea of homosexuality. At times, his voice lowers to a hoarse whisper, preparing us for a grand stroke of wisdom  but it never comes. Every once in a while, he remarks that, oh, boy, hes in trouble now, like a mischievous little boy who just cant help himself.  


  
Somewhere, buried in the nonsense, is an interesting and accurate observation about the white gay community conveniently being able to claim whiteness at will. Theres a compelling observation about the relatively significant progress the L.G.B.T.Q. community has made, while progress toward racial equity has been much slower. But in these formulations, there are no gay Black people. Mr. Chappelle pits people from different marginalized groups against one another, callously suggesting that trans people are performing the gender equivalent of blackface.  


  
In the next breath, Mr. Chappelle says something about how a Black gay person would never exhibit the behaviors to which he objects, an assertion many would dispute. The poet Saeed Jones, for example, wrote in GQ that watching The Closer felt like a betrayal: I felt like Id just been stabbed by someone I once admired and now he was demanding that I stop bleeding.  


  
Later in the show, Mr. Chappelle offers rambling thoughts on feminism using a Websters Dictionary definition, further exemplifying how limited his reading is. He makes a tired, tired joke about how he thought feminist meant frumpy dyke  and hey, I get it. If I were on his radar, he would consider me a frumpy dyke, or worse. (Some may consider that estimation accurate. Fortunately my wife doesnt.) Then in another of those rare moments of lucidity, Mr. Chappelle talks about mainstream feminisms historical racism. Just when youre thinking he is going to right the ship, he starts ranting incoherently about #MeToo. I couldnt tell you what his point was there.  


  
This is a faded simulacrum of the once-great comedian, who now uses his significant platform to air grievances against the great many people he holds in contempt, while deftly avoiding any accountability. If we dont like his routine, the message is, we are the problem, not him.  


  
This toxic performance crescendos when Mr. Chappelle shares a heartbreaking story about his trans friend Daphne Dorman, a comedian, who died by suicide  suggesting that if she was fine with his comedy, how dare anyone else have a problem? The story is bittersweet and sometimes funny, and then it is tragic, and the worst part is that Mr. Chappelle is clearly so very pleased with himself when he gets to the punchline. He thinks he has won an argument when really, he is exploiting the death of a friend. For comedy. Of course, we dont know Ms. Dorman at all; pushing back against this portrayal twists us in an impossible bind. Once more, Mr. Chappelle forestalls any resistance.  


  
One of the strangest but most telling moments in The Closer is when Mr. Chappelle defends DaBaby, a rapper in the news for making pretty egregious homophobic remarks, and his fellow comedian Kevin Hart, who once lost an Oscars hosting gig for & making homophobic remarks. Both men faced professional consequences for their missteps, but neither was canceled: Mr. Hart remains one of the highest-paid comedians in the world. DaBaby has more than 43 million monthly listeners on Spotify.  


  
At the end of his special, Mr. Chappelle admonishes the L.G.B.T.Q. community one last time, imploring us to leave his people alone. If it wasnt clear from his words, the snapshots of him with his famous pals in the closing credits of The Closer make it abundantly clear that Dave Chappelles people arent men or women or Black people. His people are wealthy celebrities, and he resents even the possibility of them facing consequences for their actions.",0.995,0.175,0.7,0.125

anyways with that said, yeah it could be used to cause conflict. one of the core tenets of entertainment is riding the fine line of conflict/controversy. that is what they teach in mass media classes at university, it is literally in the textbooks and coming out of the mouths of the teachers that what media covers is conflict. people dont pay attention unless their is some form of tension with some form of release. but oftentimes this concept is abused by people who have zero regard to their audience. see p.t barnum for reference. 

he is famous or not famous for the saying let the public be damned although there is debate whether he actually said that but, it was his attitude. he is quoted in mass broadcasting classes as well, its in the textbook.

so you may be right, entertainment has been used before to start wars, see birth of a nation for reference. 

false news has been used before to start wars, see spanish american war for reference.


https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propaganda_of_the_SpanishAmerican_War

these concepts are all taught at universities across america. probably overseas as well.

also, to add, there were laws created to stop media networks from causing public chaos after the famous broadcast about aliens, it caused major panic so the government enacted laws in order to hold media outlets accountable. see war of the worlds for reference 

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_War_of_the_Worlds_(1938_radio_drama)


those laws were for the most part decent, but they were stripped in 1985. 

so thats when media became more outrageous, right around the time of 24 hour news networks coming on the scene. see the stripping of fairness doctrine in 1987 for reference 

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/FCC_fairness_doctrine

the last remains of this doctrine were completely taken away in 2011. 

also it did not apply to online activity, so media networks started to exploit this opportunity because there were no legal and still are no legal consequences to pushing false news online and now again back in traditional broadcast media. 

not a conspiracy but, if a news network says they are balanced, they can say that even if they are not. there is no real accountability to this, no fairness doctrine, especially online. 

this conflict pads the pockets of those who have stock in the media networks, and they will viciously protect their assets at yours and the publics expense.

I'd suggest you check out Norm Macdonald (rip): his jokes are clearly written to be just that - jokes - and you know they are just that.

"I mostly agree with Vaushs take on the special. I think there were good parts but the criticism he laid out in the video were on point. 

I think blaming Dave for Daphines death is going too far.  There is no way he could have or even should have known him bringing her up in his previous special could have led to all this. She could have just as easily not identified herself to defend Dave, I doubt he expected her to. Or that the backlash she got could have helped lead to her suicide. I mean the story he told of her bombing for 45 minutes onstage and then coming back to laugh at Daves standup where she started giving it back to the crowd with the hardwood floor joke made her sound brave and tough. That seems to be the way Dave saw her, maybe he had no idea she was suffering underneath. It might also be true, perhaps very likely true her suicide had alot more to do with other issues outside of the backlash she got online. 

I dont think Dave is malicious and I dont think he hates trans people. I think the joke you highlighted at the end was a joke and nothing more. I think he was sincere in saying he is done joking about the lgbt community until they are laughing with him. I just think he has a giant blind spot in this area where he doesnt understand the effects of some of the things he has said. It seems to be a lack of perspective because as Vaush pointed out Dave did understand the concept of white people using his humor the laugh at black people rather than with them. Hopefully his last words of that special is a positive sign. 

I do agree Dave came across blaming the online trans community for her death and that was wrong.",0.627,0.176,0.669,0.155
"&gt;There is no way he could have or even should have known him bringing her up in his previous special could have led to all this.

That's not true. The special was in 2019, not 2002. The impact of transphobic media is well understood to be damaging - and it obviously is. Yet Netflix is saying today that none of this does any harm... because of Dave. Do you see the problem yet?

Look I'm not trying to say Dave had premeditated intent to kill Daphne. I'm saying that by him telling those transphobic jokes and invoking 'his trans friend' who was Daphne... he thrust her into the middle of an impossible situation and into crisis. It's always easy to say, ""she made her choices,"" but what about Dave's choices and the millions of dollars he made off the entire thing? That's just.. benign? And like... yeah, no shit she was brave and tough! Like... I can't tell you how Dave saw or see's her - but I can tell you he used her up like a resource. And is still using her death. 

Also, the idea she could have or should have stayed silent while a famous international comedian and friend references her in his show is rich. Sure, like this wasn't her career. Maybe she could have hid, but Dave would have known she didn't come to his defense. Costs and benefits- put yourself in her shoes if you can. Recall he invoked her existence to justify his jokes. And further... why it always more conveinent and safer for Trans Women to hide around cis men who make these sorts of jokes? Because this shit is clearly violence and we keep telling you as much.

So long as it's wrong of Dave to blame the online trans community, but still OK for that to be streamed to tens of millions... yet 'too far' when I blame the famous man who directly profited from the controversy... this type of pain and suffering is gonna keep happening. So long as we pretend this stuff has no consequence. Even now, as someone with tons of friends who perform at the local comedy theaters, I can choose between voicing MY opinion on Dave's transphobia and the harm he's doing/done... or to stay silent... maybe even split hairs over 'artistic license' and admire his skills at comedy while everyone laughs. Because the 'controversy' isn't just a fun little Facebook debate for me. Dave is pitting two communities I love against each other. As if they're ""different tribes"" - do you think that's how Daphne felt?

I will never be laughing with Dave on this, and Daphne will never laugh again. You can think this stuff is a joke, but it's really not. You can go read the Twitter comments Dave's audience has flooded Daphnes Twitter with - love for her and hate for the trans community. He's re-writing history and having success at it... winning the argument this stuff does no harm. And you're laughing along with him. IDK what else to say.",0.993,0.195,0.672,0.133
"Quote from Netflix's ""The Closer,"" by Dave Chappelle, emphasis mine:

""I got to tell you, Im very worried about it. *Im not even joking with you*. Every time I come out onstage, I be *scared*. I be lookin around the crowd, searching. For knuckles and Adams apples to see where the *threats* might be coming from. A n*gga came up to me on the street the other day. He said, 'Careful, Dave, they after you.' I said, 'What?' 'One they, or many theys?'""

This is threat construction. This is saying he's scared of trans people. Trans - Phobia. He's saying it's not a joke and that he is scared - and goes on to use multiple anecdotes where trans people confront him about his 'comedy' to justify his fear. He tries to say that part of the online LGBTQ+ community bullied Dorman and drove her to suicide. He see's the trans community as toxic and dangerous and is saying as much very clearly.

Same here. Luckily it was only one family member. But she posted on IG about cAnCeL cUlTuRe going too far and such.

She read it and didn't say a thing. Honestly, that stung a little worse. My partner is trans/nonbinary, so this has just been stinging a bit more on a personal level. I keep seeing trans people all over Twitter being relentlessly harassed, being told that people like them are why Daphne killed herself (even though HER OWN SISTER has said that it wasn't the reason). Netflix saying that these ""jokes"" have no repercussions is a joke in itself.

This is just exhausting. I can't even imagine how this feels for trans people.

"I do not agree with you not being mad at Netflix, and here's why:

* It will never matter how much ""good"" content they have about queer people; having something transphobic is not okay. It's like when a guy is on trial for raping someone, and his lawyer is like, ""He's captain of the football team, he's a straight-A student, he's never had a problem before,"" it's like neat but he's not on trial for his good grades, he's on trial for raping someone. It's astronomically unreasonable to *excuse* shit behavior just because it may not be the norm for the platform. Just because someone has ""Black friends"" doesn't mean that him beating a Black guy for racist reasons is okay. Transphobia is NEVER okay.
* I've an enormously fucked-up sense of humor. Personally (not saying other people should make their sense of humor like mine), I do not know of a topic that is ""off-limits"" for dark jokes, for me. I've laughed at jokes that make fun of terrible trans situations. My line, that is imperative to consider here, is whether it's actual comedy or not. Chappelle's commentary was not comedy. Comedy has a certain structure to it; when joking about a marginalized demographic, it's possible to use a stereotype to make fun of the *stereotype* itself, or the *bigots* who perpetrate the stereotype. He was not doing that, there was no joke. He was just using his platform and audience to preach bigotry, while marketing it as ""professional comedy.""
* There is a scathing problem where oppressive demographics are capitalizing on the pain of marginalized demographics. Cis people in America dress up as trans, make terrible displays and mockeries of us in movies, then earn gold in the highest award ceremonies. They're applauded for their ""amazingly authentic depiction"" of us. Meanwhile, those SAME people are NEVER doing anything to further trans rights. Most of them are transphobic, they vote against our human rights and they actively subjugate us. It's kinda like how white people appropriated Native American headdresses and whatnot for Halloween costumes; for centuries they KILLED Natives for wearing their traditional outfits, but now it's ""okay"" to wear it so long as you're a white kid playing pretend. 100% unacceptable.",-0.905,0.163,0.662,0.174
"So. I agree with most your comments and thats why I dont watch Chapelle and many comedians for a host of reasons, including transphobia. 

That being said, we all know Netflixs stance is no hate speech and no incitement of violence: it is not anti content that is offensive. It never has been, especially with comedy. 

Maybe that needs to change but I am not mad at Netflix because theyve never pretended to be anything else and I subscribed still. So really why should I be mad today as opposed to being mad last week?

Note: I dont agree with comparing the rape of a woman to airing offensive content. Theres a completely different level of violence associated with one act. As a sexual assault victim, I cant.

And I'm not saying you should suddenly be mad now, I'm saying why weren't you mad before?  


Also, I'm a sexual assault victim. My bio father raped me when I was four. I'm still in therapy for it and I'm almost 30, I've severe PTSD from it. And I'm also a trans man.

Netflix confirmed it was because the employee tried to crash a meeting to which she wasnt invited and that it wasnt the tweet that led to the decision. The reason I believe that is true is because its too easy to disprove that this happened, and, if that came out as untrue, the reputational harm Netflix would suffer would be too enormous for a company of its stature to risk. 

Maybe Im just too lenient when it comes to things like this because I have spent my entire adult life working at large corporate law firms. In my industry, we all have training re social media. So I could easily be fired for even expressing an opinion on my private Twitter (for example) that is leaked and does reputational harm to my firm. Storming a meeting?

I dont watch the shows I dont watch to watch and made it clear that I dont have a problem with Netflixs policies around screening that content - so why you suggest that I cancel my subscription and commit an actual crime, I have no clue. 

What Im doing is pointing out the hypocrisy of people who were fine when Netflix had comedians that made offensive jokes that were racist etc. They decided to work for that company. They knew who the company was. No one was hoodwinked by Netflix and this isnt the first shitty special theyve run with a comedian who is a bigot. 

Because of that, if people are only cancelling the subscriptions now (or kicking up a fuss now), then misogyny and racism and the rest was fine for them, whereas transphobia is not.

I argue that supporting a destructive capitalist institution is vastly less ethical than not. 

Will tell you that i hadnt cancelled my netflix subscriptions before NOT because I condoned any of that content, but because I genuinely did not know the content was there. I watched Castlvania, Midnight Gospel, and historical documentaries. Hell I remember watching Dave Chapelle's special about George Floyd (maybe that was on youtube tho). I am not part of those communities affected by racist standup so word of that had never reached me. 

I also recognize thats a weakness I had and will need to strengthen my connections to those communities so i do not inadvertantly support anything capable of harming marginalized groups. Because of the widespread backlash now at Dave, Im aware of those problems and am upset at those issues too.

WE CAN NOT DIVIDE OURSELVES ANY FURTHER.

Fascism will attack each marginalized group in ascending order. We need to stand as a unified front against discrimination, not tell our communities its okay to discriminate because we have been discriminated against. Thats how fascists rise to power.

Anyone from a marginalized group that gets paid to spread misinformation and bigotry about other marginalized groups is a class traitor and Chapelle chose personal wealth over actual reparations for his community and the global poor and will stand by the police as long as it protects his money.

This whole post comes across very much as saying ""hey don't be upset about that, be upset about this instead""  instead of ""hey while you're upset about this, also remember and focus on this worse thing less visible in mainstream media""",-0.984,0.067,0.691,0.242

"Apparently you live in a magical world where influential people with large platforms saying things has absolutely no effect on anybody's opinion at all. 

Please keep that fantasy in your head instead of using your naivete to attack people here for targeting hubs of radicalization.

There are innumerable people who'd never heard the word TERF before, and now have, thanks to Dave Chappelle. Maybe they held the views already. Letting them know how to easily find others and collaborate their hate, is therefore bad. Maybe they didn't, but now they can find them, and given cis people, probably at least partially agree with them. 

Reactionary idea don't magically stop spreading if people stop targeting the source of them. Half of America would still have ended up as fascists (probably more than that actually) had everyone just ignored trump. 

So I'm going to have to say t hi is. Again, apparently, to yet another trans person. Stop. Defending. Transphobes. Especially ones with massive platforms who just introduced the concept of TERFism to millions and who just accused trans people in general of bullying each other to death.

I don't usually see any.

Edit: more thoughts that came up, if you want to do good, lots of it by sharing stories like these, TRY NOT PREACHING THE CHOIR. We already goddamn know. Dave is so harmful because he spreaded a message people didn't know. Go spread it to people who don't already know this shit happens it's more productive than this shit you're doing. What else do you expect anyone on r/traaans to do other than cry for a while and try to get their nerve back to keep fighting the same battle against this they've been fighting?

That's exactly my point. People are outraged by Dave Chapelle, when in reality he's not fanning the flame or making transphobes out of otherwise normal people. Putting our energy into taking down his special is wasted. That's like trying to dam a river by putting a tent over it to stop the rain.

&gt;Stop. Defending. Transphobes. 

I'm not defending him at all- how many times in the post do I say that yes, *he is a transphobe.* No where do I say he's not, or that the things he's said aren't shitty.

&gt;Especially ones with massive platforms who just introduced the concept of TERFism to millions

Millions? After the JK Rowling incident? The TERF author of a book that's 10x more popular than Dave Chapelle all over the world?

&gt; and who just accused trans people in general of bullying each other to death.

Which, from what I can tell, is true. Her name was Daphne. She defended him, was made into the devil by her own community, and killed herself six days later.

&gt;Your entire point that is entirely sophomoric as well.

My point about human life is pretentious and juvenile? Would it be if one of the 41 people killed this year was your brother? Sister? Friend? What if it was you?

&gt;Real talk, how many people here do you think knew precise names of murdered trans people anyway? How many posts do you usually see? I don't usually see any. Nor do I typically know their names, never for long anyway

Again, that is *literally my fucking point*. No one knows 

&gt;nor do I seek out stories of things I know happened because frankly I have enough of a doomer streak

because *no one* *gives a shit*. No one posts about it. No one knows their names, or cares to.

"Dave learned nothing from his 'experiences' with the trans community and ""The Closer"" proved it. He came out yelling he's team TERF - saying explicitly that it wasn't a joke.

And you know what? He's a damn hypocrite. He thinks he should be allowed to say any damn thing he wants without consequence because he's on a stage with a microphone and is paid to do it - but wants to lamblast a nameless crowd for voicing their opinions on his opinions? If anything he should be held to a higher standard than an amorphous group of nobodies, but he isn't. 'Cause of his money and fame. Its His 'right' to mock and belittle trans women and blame the victims? No. Not in this moral universe. Not unless the point is Cis folk should be able to slag off trans people and trans folk are supposed to shut up about it. Calling the LGBTQ community hypocrites here is ***sick***.

Who started ALL of this? Dave Chappelle. Who has the POWER here? Dave Chappelle? And who's harmed - trans folk and especially trans women and trans women of color? Dave motherfucking Chappelle. Who 'helped' his 'friend' right into an early grave? You get the picture.

It's so EASY for him to throw up his hands and blame the trans community for a death of our own. To blame the people he mocks so freely. Why? Because the man hates trans people. Like, to his core. He even says it - that he's scared of us and scans for *adams apples and knuckles. Trans - Phobia. Fear of trans people. That describes accurately Dave's stated views. When I represent NO THREAT to him, but him coming to my town might make the streets less safe for me to walk at night. His 'comedy' emboldens people to mock and belittle me - and then to belittle me further when I can't 'take the joke'.

He wants and always wanted this conflict, even back when he shot Sticks and Stones. Now he wants to externalize blame and guilt from the real world harm he's created onto 'online groups'. And he wants to be celebrated for it. He's a sick man who wants to laugh about dead trans women's 'fake pussies' and I will never be laughing with him about this. He should be ashamed of himself.

I think you're barking up the wrong tree if you're getting mad at your fellow trans people about this though.

Complaining in trans spaces isn't going to do anything about that.

There's also a much clearer plan of action with canceling Chappelle than with trying to stop trans murders. It's fairly easy to cancel Netflix and encourage others to do the same.

Your original post reads like you support Chappelle and his actions, and from your posts in other subreddits, I think a lot of people are getting hung up on that. If that's not the message you wanted to send, you may want to edit your post for clarity. 

&gt; How many trans people lobbying about it on twitter every day know about the people in the post?

I don't use Twitter, so I've got no idea what actually goes on over there, but I don't really blame people for jumping on the issue that 1. is easier and less emotionally exhausting to talk about, 2. has a clearer plan of action, and 3. already has a lot of traction and thus a fairly good outlook for actually getting fixed instead of an issue that has been a problem for decades and feels impossible to fight.

&gt; Literally just acknowledge them-like, comment, post and tweet and rant about them- as much, if not more than, the words of an ignorant transphobe, instead of shutting our eyes and ears because it happens.

Just making trans people acknowledge trans suffering without having anything to do to *prevent* it is a terrible goal. When we first started seeing an increase in Asian hate, Asian-centered spaces like r/asianamerican were constantly filled with articles about hate crimes, and seeing that and sharing that all the time was stressful and exhausting, so I had to unsubscribe for my own mental well-being. I imagine a big reason why I've never had similar issues with trans spaces is because a lot of us have already learned that lesson.
