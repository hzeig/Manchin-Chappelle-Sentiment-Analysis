He represents West Virginia which is a major coal mining state. Their local economy heavily relies on coal for jobs and the revenue it brings in.  

**Here are some facts**

60% of business taxes are from companies that use coal to generate electricity. 

It provides 30,000 jobs. 

~~99%~~ 89% - 99% of West Virginias electricity comes from coal. This is just the states electricity generation, this number does not represent the entire nation.

[West Virginia Coal Rates (www.cnn.com)](https://www.cnn.com/2021/10/19/politics/west-virginia-coal-rates-manchin-climate/index.html-)

The people that live in West Virginia dont want coal to go away either. Coal is their whole lives and, for many of them, their family history. 

I understand the frustrations of this. Im an engineering student with a focus on the environment/sustainability so I can work on climate solutions, but we have to realize theres more to this than just a corrupt politician. The people he represents doesnt want coal to go away just as much as him. If we keep saying their just corrupt without realizing the real problem then nothing is going to change.

**Edit 1**

U.S. Energy Information Administration estimates West Virginias coal use for electricity generation at 91%.

I was under no illusion that election day 2020 would magically fix everything - this is a long, ugly struggle to claw power away from conservatives.

The way we win is by building upon the slivers of power we have achieved - by continuing to vote for Democrats.  By ""voting more blue"", to paraphrase your post.  The truth is if there were just one more Democrat in power in the Senate, then Manchin's ability to throw a spanner into the works would be *greatly* diminished.

"&gt;  Progressives take the wheel means nothing really...

Are you serious? Progressives mean nothing really?  They are the only reason Dems won anything in 2020. And the Lincoln Project which was all Republicans. So thank you to all our Blue rebels for throwing out the tyrant, it's a shame more aren't appreciative.  Neither will be helping DNC win their seats next week, they are fighting for the future of state legislatures, gerrymandering, electoral maps. 

The DNC is a dead seriously flawed and deceptive machine that lost us our Democracy. The Hillary election debacle against a clear facist authoritative compromised felon was proof ~ GOP established a facist regime eliminated the House of Representatives, ALL Executive and Judicial Branch oversight, put Foreign Agents in the highest positions of power, ignored the Constition, Supreme Court, Rule of Law, Eliminated Corporate Taxation and created 4 National Emergencies 'Wars' on every border and killed 1 million Americans between Oxycontin &amp; Covid hoaxing and ended with public overthrow of Soveriegn States Certified Elections, and 27 Supreme Court cases to establish Texas rules us all, all States aren't to be treated equally. Only Red States get ventilatorsvand get to Vote by Mail remember. And not one person has been held accountable that wasn't pardoned to participate in yet another insurrection on Jan 6th. If anything is proven, running for US President makes you and your foreign army immune from all international law and Democratic Constitution in perpetuity. In fact Law doesn't exist! So much Freedom! Vote for a Facist! 

Democracy over, DNC still backs the W.R.O.N.G. candidate in primaries in so MANY Presidential House &amp; Senate races compketely ignoring State Legislatures to maximize DNC Party Power and control. DNC gambling on which states even get ad cash or a drive-by visit by Hillary or Biden are more hypocritical choices showing how weak DNC long term strategy is, centralizing Party power rather than sharing it adequately between Progressives &amp; DNC &amp; Independents and Regionally. Nancy Pelosi promised to give House Leadership role to Progressives if she were given her last term, nope. DNC plays all it's cards on old heroes of lost wars for name recognition in a system that makes all the Corporate owners happy, demonizing any other option within their own party as Bernie Socialism. DNC, it's worst enemy, always splits it's own party sure workers will come through. Now it's a much different game with far different stakes requiring radical solution. 

DNC knows Sinema Manchin were NEVER blue and NEVER voted for basic blue policies, but pretend to  'negotiate' while grandstanding for their REAL Corporate Puppeteers and local money, actually doing more damage to ANY chance of Blue legislation least of all Voting Rights. Let the Republican win and take blame for hideous results, instead WVA VA AZ MI PA WI swing states will 'flip' back to GOP with new voting restrictions, embedded GQP state legislatures and plans to repopulate Mars since Corporations have mined this planet and humans to death. DNC won't mind,  they're Corporate puppets too. 'Govt By The People, For the People' experiment failed and everybody shrugs, no other option.

It's time for radical change in the way the Blue Party and our fake Democracy is run. It won't happen without Voting Rights. GOP took and is taking ours. So facism is here to stay along with the imminent GOP Revolution and Civil War - they only buy more guns and ammo, even in a pandemic and its not to fight the Russians, its to go to *actual* war with Blue, Races, Religions and toilet paper. 

The way forward is lots easier when you admit what's really happened when someone is told you 'this is your only option' 'you don't have the margins' 'it's only West Virginia'. If we all don't get a Vote anymore nothing else is possible. We are cattle, China, Russia. Manchin Sinema won't ensure their own constituents can Vote. =©=© BIG red flag =©=©They Voted against HR1.

Pretty sure you've just proven there's very little 'team effort' between actual Blue Candidates and their Voters when DNC Progressives and Moderates refuse to be civil on discussion boards while they demonize, primary and cancel each other at the polls. I'm a lifelong Dem activist who actually values the entire Blue constituency and a new model to secure State Legislatures for this  not just the DNC Power Base headliners that clearly have no power or like Manchin Sinema Lamb refuse to protect my right to Vote. 

&gt; We wouldn't have won without moderate votes

Blue didn't win Senate (it's a 'lame duck' without clear majority and VP tie-breaker) and Blue Voters abandoned Supreme Court when they Voted in Trump for 'fun'. If by moderates you mean Independents and Republicans, yes actual Republicans voted against their own party for Biden but stuck with GOP down ticket, plotting insurrection, holding Congress VP hostage to block Election Certification and git arrested in the kidnapping and assassination of a Blue Governer. Multiple sub posts and news agencies report the next Election overthrow will be successful, because 'moderate' Republicans won't be Voting Blue again. Thank 'radical socialists' Bernie and Progressives for not pulling a 3rd/Green Party splitter that would have given us a Trump dynasty lifetime appointment. 

The RNC and DNC admit they are broken because they each fail to share power between their constituent Voters (Blue= Dem, Progressive Independent) (Red= QTrumper, Evangelical, Conservatives) GOP marches like the Corporate Mercenary Army they are and destroyed Co-Equal Branches of Govt, Voting Rights, Election Law, Foreign Agency in the WH, National Security and Corp Taxes in one Presidency. DNC is still in the cannibalisation stage for inter-party dominance choosing to back saboteur DINO Republicans Manchin  Sinema &amp; Lamb over more qualified Progressives who will support HR1 aka Voting Rights.

"&gt;I mean I'm sure some are gleeful about it, but a lot of that talk is also just reality. 

It's not though, because reality is that elections are lost based on a combination of media narrative and get-out-the-vote efforts on the ground. Passing good legislation hardly ever gets anyone reelected, and it often creates a huge backlash due to misinformation like in 2010. 

Progressives (at least on reddit) are very policy-focused, so they mistakenly think that most voters are like them and pay attention to that stuff. They don't really, and the midterms are going to be about some kind of bullshit like Afghanistan or some scandal that crops up in August, or really, whatever the GOP puts their heads together about over the winter break and decides to pump into Fox News for 2022. And I guarantee you that it will not be ""Democrats can't pass progressive legislation!""

&gt;The democrats will do the regular old song and dance about how you need to vote democrat anyways and next time they'll for sure pass the legislation.

Well, a lot of that talk is also just reality. The reason we can't pass it is because the majority is too small. Not because the party doesn't want to, despite all the conspiracy theories with no evidence to the contrary. 

&gt;They keep being told ""something is better than nothing"", yet your something is their nothing and then are expected to vote in line yet again.

Yep, welcome to reality in a country where 48% of the electorate wants a fascist oligarchy, and 30% don't care about policy at all. Republicans don't whine and sulk like this when they don't get everything they want in one election. They always turn out, because they understand that the long game is what matters. Progressives constantly just talk about the next election cycle. No vision whatsoever. It's embarrassing, and it creates a self-defeating narrative that Republicans would never be so dumb as to engage in. 

&gt;But it's just not realistic to assume that next year will be the one exception and that they'll make it through unscathed.

Of course not, because the party in power always loses seats except in unique circumstances like 1998 and 2002. The question is whether having an openly fascist opposition in the wings plus a clearly defined media narrative of Republican obstructionism and insufficient democratic majorities will count as a unique circumstance. It objectively *is* a unique circumstance, so a lot of it comes down to whether or not people are willing to emphasize that reality, or perpetuate delusional crap like the idea that Bernie fucking Sanders, head of the Finance Committee, is complicit in tanking this bill because he wants to with Joe Manchin. 

When Republicans sense their elections are in trouble, they get active and take action.

"&gt; Why not mortgage debt or credit card debt?

Mortgage debt and credit card debt are taken on by adults, often trying to live beyond their means. Student loan debt is taken on by teenagers who are trying to start their lives. 

But apart from that, it's practical. You want the economy to keep churning? Having your upcoming generations begin their adult lives by being in debt and/or underemployed is not a good way to ensure your country's long-term economic health. 

Student debt also creates a shortage of critical workers in certain areas. We desperately need more primary care physicians, but it doesn't pay as well as specialties, so debt-ridden med school graduates tend to chase specialties instead. My partner is a social worker who genuinely wants to help the disadvantaged (those with substance abuse, psych disorders, etc) but can't afford to because of her student debt. She'll likely have to become a therapist for wealthy clients who can afford to pay more so she can pay off her student debt. And the people who need her help the most won't be able to get it.

No one is holding out.  It's that we're in the middle of a crisis where an entire generation of students is indebted to the government for a required part of life, and it's stifling economic growth because they can't buy shit, buy a house, have kids, etc.

Cool story.  How long did it take you to pay off your loans?  Did you suffer financial hardship due to the required education needed for that ""high paying job""?  Why haven't you bought a house already?  Sounds like you can afford it.   I took student loans for both of my degrees, and paid off both of them within about a year of graduation, but I still whole-heartedly believe that student loan forgiveness would be a boon to the economy of this country.

&gt;Americans gave everything Obama and the Dems needed to civilize our health system and they failed.

Healthcare reform wasn't a big part of the 2008 campaign, and no democrat running in 2008 ran on a promise of passing universal healthcare or a public option. Obamacare wasn't the best but it successfully moved the goalposts while improving a lot of people's lives. Only after Obamacare did M4A enter the mainstream discussion, specifically because of the incremental step that the ACA was.

&gt;This is a critical, dangerous moment and the Dems have a system where they wont/cannot wrangle rogue behavior?

Congress is not ""the democrat's system"" it's congress. Yes, apparently they cant wrangle rogue behavior. That's a problem. If you want to damage their ability to actually pass what you want them to pass by punishing them for not passing it yet, well here's a gun and there's your foot - have at it.

&gt;Can they not punish or bribe even if were on the cusp of the destruction of our democracy?

I've seen it. You're smoking crack if you think that those people would actually vote for Sanders when they get to the voting booth, let alone endorse M4A, the least-Republican policy imaginable. Republicans have the opportunity for vote for progressive candidates just as often as you do, and they choose not to, because they don't want those policies. They'll gladly embrace them after they're passed over their opposition, and be dragged kicking and screaming into a better life, but they will always vote against doing anything that helps people other than themselves. They aren't brainwashed, they just prioritize fascism and cultural issues above economic issues, which is why they consistently vote for it.

Under the circumstances of the Afghan army crumbling? Absolutely. Unless you're suggesting that we should have sent in more troops and postponed the pullout, which of course would have easily turned into a permanent postponement. 

&gt;we left billions of pieces of military hardware (that you and I paid for)

You don't seem like an idiot so I assume you are aware that you are repeating misinformation here. How about you don't?

The hardware we ""left"" was hardware in the hands of the afghan military who were supposed to use it to fight the Taliban. Do you think it would have been more competent leadership to leave them with less sufficient equipment to cover our retreat?

&gt;Sorry, I just have standards for my government I guess.

Indeed you do. They seem largely informed by Hollywood and Tom Clancy. I prefer to base my standards on reality.

&gt;I blamed the leadership, and you heard me curse the people on the ground?

Well you didn't give any clear critique of what the leadership did wrong, and given that the main bad thing that people are aware of is that the Taliban took over too quickly and a big suicide bomb went off, who else other than the people on the ground is there left to blame? No obviously you're not blaming them, but the reality is that most of what went wrong was unpreventable, so your attempts to assign blame anywhere don't make much sense, which is what I'm pointing out.

&gt; And why are you so determined to find zero flaws in Trump and Bidens plan?

Because I've followed that stupid fucking war for 20 years and I'm aware of what is and isn't possible. Trump's plan was absolutely flawed, and him cutting out the Afghan government from the process was a huge mistake that potentially could have prevented some of the chaos, but the best he could have done is create a situation where we pulled out less quickly and more afghans died in the defensive fighting against the Taliban who would inevitably win. It would have been worth trying, but probably wouldn't have made a big difference. Trump was an asshole for ripping the band-aid off without even trying to mitigate the pain, but the bandaid needed to be ripped regardless. 

&gt; You think there was no possible way the pullout could have been smoother?

Other than the aforementioned Trump screw-up, no. Or to put it another way, once Biden was in office and decided to fulfill the pullout rather than risk re-entrenchment, I do not see any way it could have gone smoother given what was inevitable at that point, and I think we actually pulled of something of a miracle in that regard with zero American civilian casualties, one of the most logistically impressive evacuation campaigns of all history (not exaggerating at all), and relatively few military casaulties, and no real geopolitical fallout to speak of.

As opposed to what we have now?

I think what you're suggesting is mildly applicable in the wake of Dukakis' showing against Reagan, but neither before nor for long after.  Carter had already taken an anti-union stance, among other pro-corporate positions.  Clinton was more effective in pushing the anti-welfare state, pro-corporate wage cutting than his Republican predecessors.  By the time you get to Obama, the effect you describe was completely gone, and Democrats wanted socialized medicine and traditional Democratic policies.  We got a measure to put off the former, and nothing in therms of the latter.

How does appointing industry lobbyists to run the regulator agencies overseeing those industries, every bit as consistently as Republicans, serve to woo voters?  That's one of many examples where their conservative actions have been a detriment to, not an aid to winning votes.  Look at right now, and the popularity of countless measures that are falling by the wayside.  Is that also to win votes?  Or is it because they're put into office by precisely the same powers as those that put Republicans in power.  You notice that over the time from Carter to now, the major donors have increasingly shared by the two parties.

And lets not get started on the complete absorption of Democrats into the military-industrial complex, surveillance state.

Edit: I'd also add that without the Vietnam War, Johnson would have been one of the most popular presidents ever.  Because of the then controversial Civil Rights Act, but even more because of the not-at-all controversial Great Society policies.  Democrats broke with that tradition not because it wasn't getting votes, but because of corporate lobbying, and membership.  Carter lost not because he wasn't fiscally conservative enough, but because of the Arab Oil Embargo, and likely the illegal October Surprise negotiations by Republicans.","{0.55, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, -1.45, 0, 0, 0, 0.85, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3.5895, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, -0.75, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3.15, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3.6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3.15, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, -0.9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4.2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2.1, 0, 0, 0, 2.55, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3.219, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3.1395, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, -1.2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, -1.2, 4.65, 0, 0, 0, -2.7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, -0.45, 0, 0, 0, -1.95, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, -3.9, 0, 1.65, 0, 0, 0}",0.985,0.134,0.802,0.063,4

Bernie Sanders--as you point out--is not a Democrat. He runs as an independent, with the official backing of no recognized party. Nonetheless he has to be counted with the party for some purposes--he caucuses with them in the Senate, accepts committee assignments from the Majority Leader, and, of course, campaigned for the party's Presidential nomination two elections in a row.

What he needs to explain in painstaking detail is why he can't make all his negotiation demands at once.

He at least *has* an ideology, and good-faith negotiations might actually be possible with him if he were the only holdout. I won't pretend that his ideology isn't influenced by money, of course, but it's hardly a scandal that the senator from WV takes money from the most significant economic sector in WV.

"I just cant understand peoples obsession with party.  In my home state of Oklahoma, the State Superintendent of Education (a Republican), switched to the Democratic Party so that she could run for Governor in 2022 (and most likely to quell a very popular progressive in the primary).  

So should voters automatically support her merely because shes a Democrat, as though she actually never changed platforms?  (Although, to be fair, theres not much difference between Democrats and Republicans on economic issues, so maybe it doesnt matter much.  We either get a corporate puppet with a red tie or a corporate puppet with a blue tie.)

"&gt; we're lucky he didn't decide to take your advice and do nothing instead of picking up the pieces and passing the ACA

Are we?  Consider: we're back to the point where the healthcare system is in crisis.  A majority of Americans agree our healthcare system is not working. The ACA helped for a time, but it also defused the political will to enact meaningful change -- it basically kicked the can down the road to 2020.  

Furthermore, even protecting that watered-down kicking-the-can-down-the-road solution has required a massive amount of political capital. The Republicans still used the ACA to rally a base of intense opposition and controlled all 3 branches of government for years.  

We don't know what would have happened if Obama had truly fought for the necessary changes rather than accepting them being watered down.  We might have seen the real reform needed, or we might have seen the situation get bad enough that voters pushed *even Republicans* to support *real solutions.* 

This is the problem with What-Ifs.  

&gt; Biden faced a choice between passing part of his agenda 

Most of Biden's agenda is effectively dead at this point, not just the climate change portion.  Manchin and Sinema are primarily responsible for that -- by blocking removal of the fillibuster. 

[Biden's approval rating has been on a steady decline as a result.](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/biden-approval-rating/) Early evidence suggests the 2022 midterms will *not* be kind to the Democrats as a result. 

&gt; Manchin also has nothing left to lose by bucking his party

That's a potentially accurate point, sadly.  But the party also has a lot more to lose by him remaining a part of it than it stands to gain. 

Again: if Democrats fail on this issue, it will be a failure that hurts the entire party.  I think you really underestimate how many voters will refuse to show up for the Democrats if they can't pass meaningful climate policy.  This and healthcare are THE issues for many voters under 40 -- and the Boomers aren't going to be around forever.","{0.55, 0, 0.9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, -1.55, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0.75, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1.95, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1.95, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0.45, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2.85, -1.95, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2.4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, -3.75, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2.55, 0, 1.05, 0, 0, 0, -2.55, 0, 0, 1.65, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2.85, -4.95, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1.95, 0, 0, 0, 0, -2.4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3.15, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, -2.664, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1.65, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1.887, 0, 0, 0, 2.55, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, -2.7, 0, 0, 2.55, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, -2.967525, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3.6, 0, 0, 0, -3.75, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, -3.45, 0, -3.15, 0, 0, 2.55, 0, 0, 0, 0, -2.2395, 0, 0, 0, 0, -1.8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, -1.443, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0}",-0.367,0.142,0.725,0.133,2

I know you're just trying to be a troll with this remark, but it's worth addressing anyway.  Eventually, yes, even Republicans will support climate policies.  The evidence has mounted to the point where it's impossible to ignore, and people are starting to connect it with real and personal harm to them and their children.

"&gt; Solving climate change is a matter of survival.

Climate change isn't going to make the planet uninhabitable. The dirty truth is if you live in a rich country you're going to be shielded from most of the effects of climate change. A lot of people here think it's going to be the end of the world if we don't do anything, where mainstream climate scientists think that it will just be shitty.

For example look at studies that estimate the number of climate change deaths if we continue on the path we are on right now. 73 deaths per 100,000 people globally per year in 2100:

https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/aug/04/rising-global-temperatures-death-toll-infectious-diseases-study

Or 1.5-2 million deaths a year globally in 2100:

https://www.impactlab.org/news-insights/valuing-climate-change-mortality  
https://www.eenews.net/assets/2018/04/04/document_gw_09.pdf

Which is fucking awful but isn't a ""collapse of society"" event. For comparison, 10 million people die a year from poverty right now.

Or look at how it will effect the economy. Not doing anything would [shave 10% off GDP,](https://www.washingtonpost.com/weather/2019/08/19/climate-change-could-cost-us-up-percent-its-gdp-by-study-finds/) but that would be 10% off [from growth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_past_and_projected_GDP_(nominal\)#Long_term_GDP_estimates) that is a lot more then 10%. It would be awesome to have that extra 10% of GDP, but it's not the end of the world if we don't.

&gt;It is immediately apparent that economic costs will vary greatly depending on the extent to which global temperature increase (above preindustrial levels) is limited by technological and policy changes. At 2°C of warming by 208099, Hsiang et al. (2017) project that the United States would suffer annual losses equivalent to about 0.5 percent of GDP in the years 208099 (the solid line in figure 1). By contrast, if the global temperature increase were as large as 4°C, annual losses would be around 2.0 percent of GDP. Importantly, these effects become disproportionately larger as temperature rise increases: For the United States, rising mortality as well as changes in labor supply, energy demand, and agricultural production are all especially important factors in driving this nonlinearity.

&gt;Looking instead at per capita GDP impacts, Kahn et al. (2019) find that annual GDP per capita reductions (as opposed to economic costs more broadly) could be between 1.0 and 2.8 percent under IPCCs RCP 2.6, and under RCP 8.5 the range of losses could be between 6.7 and 14.3 percent. For context, in 2019 a 5 percent U.S. GDP loss would be roughly $1 trillion.

... and the extreme weather events we're seeing today are at just +1.1C. 

**Climate change doesn't have to make the planet entirely unliveable to cause mass suffering and disruption to normal lives.**

**Big edit:** 

Similarly, climate change doesn't have to *literally* make the entire planet uninhabitable to cause massive social impacts.  Extreme weather events triggered by climate change show a high potential to cause crop failures, and changes in growing zones and overall climate patterns will disrupt agriculture.  This can quickly have a destabilizing effect on social stability. [The Arab Spring was linked to spiking bread prices](https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2011/jul/17/bread-food-arab-spring).  Furthermore some areas such as India are [facing an emerging threat of deadly heatwaves](https://www.theweek.in/news/sci-tech/2021/09/09/heatwaves-have-emerged-as-a-deadly-health-hazard-in-india.html).  There are a few key factors to remember here:

* Extreme weather events and changing climate patterns will adversely effect agriculture -- food shortage triggers social instability locally and may cause mass migrations (edit: some degree of climate-related population migration is already a consensus view from climate researchers)
* Deadly heatwaves and food shortages or repeated extreme weather events will trigger large population migrations
* We already saw the social division with an influx of migrants from the Syrian Civil War -- I am a firm believer in open borders, but unfortunately there are always far-right groups that see this as a threat, and mass refugees trigger them to become more active and violent
* All of the above could easily lead to local wars -- and potentially larger conflicts as bigger nations align with specific factions
* Global trade is *heavily* interconnected -- the Pandemic has illustrated how fragile this is, and how much disruptions in one place cause ripple effects and shortages in seemingly unrelated areas -- these disruptions will only increase due to the above plus increased extreme weather.  
* Much of our current standard of living is based on global trade and global cooperation
* If there is sufficient disruption from the above factors, the overall globalized system will break down and we will see something different that is more localized and more nationalism as nations focus on their own interests when fighting for resources.  People will survive but it won't be the standard of living we know today.","{0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, -0.5, 0, 0, 0, -0.2, 0, -1.45, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0.4, 0, -0.55, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, -1.05, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, -1.05, 0, -0.75, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, -1, 0, 0, 0, 0.35, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, -1.2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, -0.4, 0, 0, 0, 0, -0.5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, -0.3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, -1.45, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, -2.1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, -3.6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2.9895, 0, -4.74555, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2.1, 0, 0, 0, -3.9, 0, 0, 0, 0, -2.4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, -2.1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, -0.9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, -2.1, 0, 0, 1.95, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1.65, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, -2.25, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1.5, 0, -2.25, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0}",-0.989,0.037,0.84,0.123,2

"I agree with you that the market will help (renewable energy taking over is inevitable based on the economics, and anybody saying otherwise has not looked at the recent numbers).  I agree with you that ""decarbonising electricity is both easier than and necessary for decarbonising other sectors."" 

But the problem is overall decarbonisation velocity and how powergrid emissions interact with the rest of greenhouse emissions reductions.  To have a decent shot at 1.5C-2C we really do need to decarbonise the vast majority of the powergrid by 2030 (to achieve the 50% emissions reduction needed at that point).

Electricity generation [on its own does not account for the largest share of US emissions, per LLNL](https://flowcharts.llnl.gov/content/assets/images/charts/Carbon/Carbon_2019_United-States.png).  It's only 31.5%, and transportation is slightly more.  

To bring the rest of the emissions under control, we need to electrify transportation, industry, and building heating.  Electrification [will dramatically cut the amount of rejected energy, which accounts for roughly 2/3 of total primary energy use in the US](https://flowcharts.llnl.gov/content/assets/images/energy/us/Energy_US_2020.png) -- electric motors and heat pumps are vastly more energy-efficient than their fossil fuel competion.  Even when powered by dirty energy sources, this will cut emissions some.  Industrial process heat will likely be 1-for-1 in terms of efficiency (electric resistance heating etc aren't any more efficient compared to burning fuels).

But that electrification will substantially increase electricity consumption, and electrification initiatives are also slow (read: decades) and requires steep capital investments.  If the powergrid is vast-majority-green, then electrification delivers *substantially* higher emissions reductions. 

To add to this: it seems likely that policymakers are *underestimating* how easy it will be to mostly decarbonise the powergrid (based on exponential growth trends and plummeting costs for renewables and storage) -- but they are likely *also* under-estimating how hard it will be to address the more difficult structural emissions sources.  Land-use and agriculture emissions are particularly pernicious and difficult to address without major social changes.  Cement emissions aren't likely to go away any time soon.

If there was some magic words he could speak into the bully pulpit to make them fall in line we would have heard them by now. 

The only reason a bully pulpit, or internal pressure, would work is confidence that they have nowhere to go when pressured, that they want to stay as part of the party at the end of the day. but theoretically they can go into mcconnel's beckoning arms, The only reason we would say that's unlikely is loyalty to the party and I wouldn't really bank to hard on that loyalty with these two.

Theres no guarantee they will stay democrat if biden and Schumer start pushing hard, and if one of those two flip, everything is lost. The legislative agenda. Even the stuff we're currently getting, that is to say the court appointees, and the cabinet appointees..

We would even lose budget reconciliation, all it would take is one of them to flip and we lose our chance at passing budget through reconcilliation. Which means any budget would have to be greenlit by mcconnel,  just let that idea sink in. McConnell has gone on record he wants to obstruct.  It doesn't take much to  envision how much damage he can inflict.

"The DNC sent 50 million unvaccinated kids back to school (""back to normal!"") to keep ""the economy"" healthy, anti-science, while enabling more drilling and ""nothing fundamentally changing for the rich"" (more anti-science).. Florida got a $15/hr minimum wage increase (when you can't afford a 2-bedroom anywhere in the country on less than $21/hr).. and a ""Democrat"" stopped it federally. Massive new military/Pentagon spending, mass evictions, abortion less legal than it was last year, Supreme Court unbalanced, billionaires becoming untaxed trillionaires (spellcheck doesn't even recognize ""trillionaires"".. but it will, oooh, it will! When you're that rich and ""politics"" is for purchase, no one can afford to ignore you..).

The current corporate DNC is all the ""GOP"" that ""Freedom""><U+0085>"" can endure, I think. And this is them in ""full control"", and ""post-Trump"", in the face of a very obvious and worsening capitalism/Exxon-fueled climate crisis.

We're supposed to be relocating people out of high-eco-stress/flood areas and conserving 35+% of all natural land permanently, and things like building carbon reclamation towers, recycling/waste management infrastructure, windmill farms and solar conversion for all homes, ""essential worker""/doctor/student protections (for this pandemic and the next, climate-crisis-driven), currently. Instead, Insurrectionist Trump is eating ice cream. Joe is eating ice cream. Pelosi is posing with thousands of dollars of ice cream.

A lot of people have been watching billionaire's rockets launches from their tents, lately (assuming their sometimes-""blue"", sometimes-""red"", city officials don't choose to destroy their tents, since one traumatic eviction apparently isn't enough).

The only thing the GQP isn't ""getting"" right now is a direct advancement of authoritarian fascism, but that's fine by them because *indirectly* nothing is fundamentally changing. Filibuster lives, ""fake news"" is just fine, voting is insecure, old ""fixers"" walk free while whistleblowers like Daniel Hale are swiftly punished..

Rittenhouse's judge (Trump appointed? Remember that? ""If she gets her judges in, folks.. nothing you can do.. unless..""? Some early projection!) said today that no one is allowed to refer to the people Rittenhouse murdered as ""victims"". ""Victims"" is not okay with the ""judge"", but ""arsonists"", ""looters"", and ""rioters"" is just fine.

Watching the DNC's ""response"" to the recent Pandora Papers and Facebook Papers/whistleblowers, as well. For now, most of them continue to support insurrection-fueling Facebook (many of the publications covering it are in lucrative article-sharing partnership with Facebook). We found out ATnT is OANN/terrorist-inflaming.. but did Joe (or anyone) return their ATT ""donations""?

What's left to wish for? They can take a 4 year vacation, enjoy the accountability-free looting they pulled off under Trump.. and wait.. what was it, ""stand back and stand by""? Worst thing is you can rub their ""Trump-era"" tweets in their faces, all the big (and vital) talk they never planned on delivering on (except.. it's absolutely necessary..).

I also think they're not really accounting for how many people Trump and Friend's braying woke up, politically.

"Please allow me to clarify.  If this country does, in fact, descend into fascism, which is a very real possibility, we should be looking at all the earmarks of what's really going on: 

1. [There have been claims of stolen elections before all votes have been counted or, in some cases, before elections have even taken place](https://archive.vn/vZlMe).
2. [Laws preventing minority groups from voting](https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/research-reports/voting-laws-roundup-october-2021)
3. [Laws have been passed that restrict the constitutional rights of anyone who isn't white, male, heterosexual, and Christian, while at the same time enhancing the rights of those in power who are](https://www.houstonchronicle.com/politics/texas/article/Abortion-restrictions-transgender-issues-gun-15973501.php). (A side-effect of these laws will be that they will serve to distract from the voter restriction laws that would help prevent the unconstitutional stripping of rights of minorities.  [One look at the list of voting rights issues the ACLU is fighting in cases across the country](https://www.aclu.org/issues/voting-rights) tells us that they simply don't have enough time between now and midterm elections, or even the next presidential election, to litigate all these claims.)
4. [Some states have either passed or are discussing passing anti-protest bills that would limit/prohibit public protests in violation of our First Amendment rights](https://www.aclu.org/issues/free-speech/rights-protesters/anti-protest-bills-around-country).  Some of these same states have [criminalized any effort for protestors to defend themselves against attacks from citizens, cops, or even motorists attempting to run them down in the street, and they've even gone so far as to absolve motorists of any criminality in running down protestors](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/21/us/politics/republican-anti-protest-laws.html).

Of course, this is just a cursory overview of the tactics being employed by the right, as we've all seen from the wonderful posts by u/rusticgorilla.  The purpose of all this is a recipe for a consolidation of power, one that they perfected in the late--'70s/early-'80s, when Jerry Falwell and [Paul Weyrich, co-founder of the Heritage Foundation and originator of the term ""moral majority,""](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/20/magazine/trump-government-heritage-foundation-think-tank.html) worked to [coalesce Evangelicals and Catholics around the idea of being anti-abortion](https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2014/05/religious-right-real-origins-107133/).  They were able to form the religious right, and they swayed voters to their true cause, which was segregation.

Thus, time has grown short.  Even if Democrats were to win elections in vote-restricted, gerrymandered districts, what is the likelihood that those results would stand, since the new tactic has been to challenge any and all election results?  While it may not work to their favor in the short-term, in the long-run, the effect it will have is diminished voter turnout, b/c voters will grow apathetic.  They will think that their vote wouldn't make a difference, b/c it was simply going to be challenged every time, and even if the voting results weren't overturned, new laws restricting more and more voters' rights to vote would be passed.

When all of this is taken into account, Manchin and Sinema have a duty to uphold the Constitution for their constituents, and they're purposefully failing to do that.

"If we take a look at what solutions Democrats feel are necessary to implement to go about [""Restoring and Strengthening Our Democracy,""](https://democrats.org/where-we-stand/party-platform/restoring-and-strengthening-our-democracy/) we can see that they're overlooking the immediacy of the issues in front of them.  Sure, they're looking to ensure voting rights, but that's as much about keeping them in office as it is about ensuring the constitutional rights of citizens.  What I don't see in their list is how to deal w/ the fascism and criminality that's become a staple of the force opposing them.

For a while, I couldn't understand what it was about the Democrats that made them unwilling to deal w/ this glaringly troublesome issue staring them right in the face.  They didn't talk about in those terms; they didn't deal w/ it in those terms; they didn't attempt to pass legislation that would inhibit the rise of this fervent fascination that the right had w/ fascism.  Day after day of examples would be trotted out by the right, and yet, the Dems would seemingly be oblivious to it all.

Then, when Manchin and Sinema pushed back on everything, the reason why dawned on me.  It was b/c, these so-called centrist Dems aren't really centrists at all.  They're really on the right in many of their values, so what the ""Republicans"" are doing isn't too far a stretch for what these Dems actually believe in.  For many of us, especially progressives, we view their actions as abhorrent and fascisistic, but to these Dems, they're just not seeing it that way.

**The Brookings Institution** \- [Cybersecurity and Election Interference](https://www.brookings.edu/series/cybersecurity-and-election-interference/) \[July, 2019 - December, 2019\]: This series, designed to be accessible to policymakers, journalists, and the general public, will explore digital threats to American democracy, cybersecurity risks, and ways to mitigate possible problems.

**Brennan Center for Justice** \- Their series is simply referred to as [""Our Issues""](https://www.brennancenter.org/issues) \[2019-2021\].  Each issue covered will have anywhere from one-to-four articles discussing that topic.  For instance, the first issue is titled ""Ensure Every American Can Vote,"" and this topic is discussed in three articles, ""Voting Reform,"" ""Voting Rights Restoration,"" and ""Vote Suppression.""  Each issue comes w/ a *wealth* of information from a ""Why it Matters"" section to a ""Fact Sheet"" to the ""Projects"" that are ongoing to ensure these processes are put into place, some of which the Brennan Center is directly involved w/.

There is no such thing as ""conservative"" fiscal policy in the United States; there never really has been in the contemporary era, and it drives me *insane* that the media continues to mindlessly parrot the word.  It is a meaningless descriptor used in place of describing Republicans actually are: the governmental apparatus for crony capitalism.

There has *never* been an actual consistent ideological standard for conservative economic policy other than ""tAx CuTs"" which itself is really nothing more than low-effort pandering to  ill-informed and uninformed voters.

Everything else they ""stand for"" is completely malleable.  When they are in power, they use the government to give massive handouts to the rich and the private sector, and you never hear a peep about ""fiscal conservatism"".  When Democrats are in power, Republicans are hair-on-fire crazy about the debt, deficits, bureaucracy, entitlements, etc. etc. 

The contrast between what conservatives want to spend money on vs. what liberals want to spend money on could not be clearer.  Liberals want to spend this money improving national infrastructure, guaranteeing access to decent health care for everyone, improving public education, and giving a base-level fuck about maintaining a climate that is suitable for HUMAN FUCKING LIFE.

If you are someone who just cannot figure out what is wrong with these right-wing crazies and their rhetoric filled with overt racism, gun worship, whacko conspiracy theories, and distorted Christianity... well, here it is:  the people in charge are using every bit of that to distract the peons from what they are really trying to do, which is juice this country and its people for every single dime they can to further insulate themselves from the rest of us.

The reason Trumpism is so damn scary to so many ""mainstream"" Republicans is that now, their voters have become so brainwashed by all the issues they've been using as distractions for decades, they're beginning to elect more and more leaders from among their own ranks rather than coronating rich folks who are already in on the whole grift. 

And therein lies the grandest irony of it all... before too long, the crazies will begin to pose an actual threat to the stability of the crony capitalist scheme.

Coal is, by comparison, incredibly cheap to acquire, transport, and convert to energy, which are the primary costs that would directly affect its use in the market.

Natural gas is overall cheaper than coal.  It is *far* more energy efficient to burn and is actually cheaper to extract and transport over the long term than coal.

I don't actually like Pakman very much because he is often way too comfortable with compromise for my tastes, so it was a bit disconcerting to hear him advocate for progressives to [withdraw support for BIF](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TggE939vK4) and reconciliation bill over the immense watering down.

Personal Take:

I think it might be better for progressives to leverage their power right now to hold BIF hostage and make a list of 10 demands for Biden to do via executive order. Biden is showing himself to be willing to accommodate Manchin and Sinema on their demands on a gutless reconciliation bill. I think he can be pushed to do at least some of the things below, if progressives show that they are willing to shoot down BIF and reconciliation.

 Something along the lines of 

(1) [Forgive all student debt](https://fortune.com/education/business/articles/2021/10/20/schumer-biden-can-and-should-cancel-50000-in-student-debt/) (if you say all, it'll end up actually being $5-$10,000 per person)

(2) [Effectively decriminalize weed by de-scheduling weed.](https://www.brookings.edu/blog/fixgov/2021/05/24/why-has-president-biden-been-slow-to-embrace-cannabis-reform/) [Pardoning all nonviolent offenders/commuting their sentences](https://www.politico.com/news/2021/02/11/biden-clemency-criminal-justice-468539).

(3) [Create Postal Banking](https://www.vox.com/21557717/joe-biden-executive-order-student-debt-climate)

(4) [Request Federal Reserve to include climate change under consideration for businesses and increase minimum reserve balances for banks lending to fossil fuel companies or involved in other risky businesses.](https://www.vox.com/21557717/joe-biden-executive-order-student-debt-climate) Deny all new fossil fuel permits.

(5) [Impose a size cap on banks](https://www.vox.com/21557717/joe-biden-executive-order-student-debt-climate)

(6) [Actually and swiftly close Guantanamo Bay](https://www.cnn.com/2021/09/19/politics/guantanamo-state-of-play/index.html)/Enact other anti Imperialist substantial foreign policy

(7) [Require Publicly Traded businesses to include the M3 form in their public financial disclosures. The M3 form details the firm's explanation for why their income reported to the IRS differs from the one reported to investors.](https://www.vox.com/21557717/joe-biden-executive-order-student-debt-climate)

(8) [Provision in ACA gives president to give everyone the option to use Medicare in the event of an environmental emergency](https://prospect.org/day-one-agenda/how-biden-could-give-everyone-medicare-on-his-own/) (like a pandemic).

(9) Change the definition of poverty to reflect reality. OPM standards are way out of date and don't take into account how various necessities have far outpaced inflation. It would mean more individuals would qualify for various social welfare programs even under means testing attempts.

(10) [Approve states request to buy drugs from Canada](https://www.mysuncoast.com/2021/06/01/desantis-urges-ok-get-prescription-drugs-canada/). Or [use march in rights to lower drug costs](https://jacobinmag.com/2021/10/drug-prices-march-in-bayh-dole-act-biden-administration-xavier-becerra) for drugs that were in anyway developed or funded by the government or based on government funded research.

Ofc Biden isn't going to say yes to all of them, but he would definitely buckle on at least 3 if progressives demanded he do these exceutive orders in the next 2 months or BIF and reconciliation are both dead.

It's time for progressives to learn some moves from the Tea party, and it seems [AOC is getting the message a little bit](https://fortune.com/education/business/articles/2021/11/01/aoc-its-time-to-bring-the-heat-on-biden-to-cancel-student-loans/).

Also I disagree with Pakman to completely kill, because Dems do have until December 2022 and bills can always be brought back to the floor.

The number has been lowered to $1.75 trillion already (I suspect the final version will end up around $1.5 trillion), and currently it's actually going to give a sizable tax cut to the wealthiest American landowners with very minimal changes to TCJA. I don't really see it going up because I don't think Progressives are that skilled. 10 demands is simpler to demand and making it on popular progressive policies will make it far easier to message on.

"If Dems pick up a seat, he still has power because he faaaar more reasonable than Synema. Basically the entire party lets her play her dumbass game and he gets all the concessions.

You offer his future power potential as a binary, Dems pick up a seat or lose two. There is a third option though. The Senate stays 50/50. If it stays 50/50, and he switches making it 51/49, the only way he keeps his power is if McConnell *lets* him. In that case McConnell just says ""vote with us, or your political career is over."" And McConnell would be right. If he switched and tried this same bullshit, McConnell is perfectly content with Congress doing nothing. Then he waits for the next primary, dumps money into his primary challenger, and spends the entire campaign blaming Manchin for *everything* and calling him a spy/plant/snake.

And saying he's more likely to win as a Republican ignores the fact that he will 100% face a Trump embracing primary fight.

I cant respond to you below because I have been banned for allegedly encouraging people to break the law.

So heres my response below:

There is no democracy or rule of law. There never was. Just poor weak shallow façades.

I mean my answer is No. (I am literally flaired Independent because of how much I detest certain Dems) but Im just showing how law is irrelevant when it comes to politics.

What matters is not what you or I or the Constitution say is legal. What matter is what money and power you have and how you plan to use them and how much do people care about it.

Trump got impeached twice and 73 million people yawned.

If the Constitution was followed to a T we would still be a third world country without a highway system or any way to transport goods anywhere.

If international law and the Geneva convention was followed to a T every single American president post WW2 would be hung.

Money and power are already used to buy key elections and key politicians. Otherwise doing popular s*** like having Medicare negotiate drug prices would not be so damn painful.

I thoroughly enjoyed this discussion. I am probably not going to be able to respond again. So in summary, I would argue the divide isnt between short and long term but between whats nominally legal in the eyes of 5 people on the bench and what isnt.

It's still really dumb. Biden simply isn't in a position to grant every progressive wish list. The reason for that is that we have the slimmest majority possible in the Senate. Every single Democrat needs to be on board with a bill or it doesn't pass. That includes two pretty conservative Democrats who aren't interested in these progressive positions, and at times are actively hostile to some of them. And that's just to pass anything in budget reconciliation, otherwise nothing is getting passed. 

The solution to these issues is voting more Democrats into office so we can actually get shit done. I mean hell right now progressives have more political power than they've had in literally decades. They have a friendly president who's working with them to set goals and policy for the entire party, and even with the split in the Democratic party we've seen some pretty progressive policy enacted and are likely to get some more.

"&gt; Democrats have differed over how to trim the size of the package, with progressives pushing for the party to reduce the duration of many of the bills different programs and preserve them all, even if just for a short duration.

When debating how to focus our efforts under financial constraints, moderates have it right and progressives have it wrong. Its better to do a few things and do them really well and fund them for a long time so they can make a noticeable difference in peoples lives.

"Yes, we believe that people should be responsible for their actions. However, we acknowledge that the decision to act a certain way can be influenced by varying factors like the system or society. This is also the reason why we talk about incentives in a system, especially if we criticize  policies. You have to look at the whole decision-making process and not just at the action and the outcome. And here you can clearly see that this so-called contradiction doesn't exist since the systemic influence on one's decision is represented in this process. 

In your example, this would mean that yes, Joe Manchin is responsible for his actions but the system in itself creates contradicting incentives that influences his decisions. Interestingly enough, institutions that were influenced by classical liberalism still take this into account. For example, a court analyses the factors that influenced the decision to act in a criminal way. I find it interesting that you call us irrational and unnuanced while also creating a premise that likely doesn't exist just to create an ad hominem argument. Aren't logical fallacies irrational?

Edit: I have some things to add to my comment. In another comment, OP says that socialist look at the decision-making process and incentives and then says that capitalists are incapable of this which is interesting since the whole capitalist analysis of the overall economy is based on the analysis of incentives. The best examples are the Lucas critique or the Cobra effect. Thinking in incentives is one of the most important things in economics and is also quite often used to criticize policies by liberal parties. Furthermore, there are also socialists that are incapable of thinking in this way because this kind of thought process has nothing to do with socialism or capitalism.

"&gt; The politician's sworn duty is to the public. They literally take an oath. Not every politician is corrupt, so it's not a systemic problem. Corruption is definitely an individual choice. 

If your system relies on individuals having a certain virtue, and they often do not have that virtue, then the problem is systemic. You can blame the individuals if you'd like, but at a certain point it's stupid to keep trusting them.

So if you want to call individual politicians bad and untrustworthy people for taking bribes, fine. But if you continue to stake the health of your democracy on them *not* taking bribes, and then many of them take bribes just like in the past, then that is a bad system. And scolding the individuals within it won't make the system work any better.

At a certain point, you need to decide whether you care more about adjudicating the virtues of individuals, or building a functional society. I care about the second one.

Yeah that's why slaveowners had tiny houses and no political power. Cause slavery isn't profitable.

&gt; You have always been free to live in your system with likeminded socialists. Your system can't involve forcing others to live in your system.

I can't believe that you're being genuine when you say this. Both of our systems require the infrastructure and resources that we both rely on now. In a socialist system, you would not strike out on your own and build from the ground up a liberal economy. You would want continued access to the society you live in, and a say in how that society is structured. So do we.

And any system invovles some amount of force. It's just naive to think otherwise. Any system, capitalism and socialism included, involve forcing people to behaving in a certain way. Liberalism is the system which you believe forces people to do the right thing (i.e., you think it's right to force me to respect private property), but that is force. And as natural as you think it is to force me to respect private property, I think it's just as natural and obvious to violate private property and forcible ensure that people's needs are met.

Those corporate interests are not bribing the powerful just because they love bribing. They're doing it in order to accomplish something, usually an economic environment which helps them profit.

&gt;They're doing it in order to accomplish something, usually an economic environment which helps them profit. Limiting the purview of the gov't doesn't remove their incentive to profit, and it does not remove the resources with which they'll seek that. Does that not make sense?


It does not. Limiting the purview of the gov't absolutely removes any incentive for politicians to be bribed.

&gt;Where do you imagine the power goes? Does it disappear?

Yes. Without gov't guns, threat disappears. Limited gov't is there to prevent the Mafia state, not to create it.","{1.1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1.4, 0, 0, -0.8, 0, 1.4, 0, 0, -0.8, 0, 0, 1.7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1.3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1.4, 0, 0, -0.8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, -0.8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1.5, 0, 0, 0, -2.9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1.8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1.6, 0, 1.9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, -1.11, 0, 1.9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1.7637, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, -0.9, 1.7, 0, 0, 0, 1.776, -1.4, -0.9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0.1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, -0.814, 0}",0.952,0.211,0.672,0.117,0

The incentive of benefit is existentially implicit. There's no getting around it. Power breeds corruption. Socialism engenders the most power.

The US has very-well distributed property power, with 32.5 million businesses and 18 million millionaires. Real-world socialism destroys that distribution and pools all that power into the gov't.

&gt; Not trampling it is the protection. 

I'm sorry I don't see how you think that works.

I think you're saying that the constitution is a protection against the state trampling your rights. But there the constitution is, proudly displayed, and the state is trampling it and your rights. So clearly the constitution does not protect you. If the state abode by the constitution it wouldn't be trampling your rights, sure. But, it's not abiding by the constitution. How would you make the state abide by the constitution? You can't just invoke the constitution like a spell, you need some material power here, which it is clear the constitution does not provide.


&gt; You may have never read it. It is a power-limiting document.

Ok, well I think you'll find that writing something down in a document doesn't make it so. If you'd like proof of this, may I direct your attention to a document called ""The Constitution,"" which forbids many of the things that our government is currently doing.

The constitution *would* protect your rights, if the state obeyed it. And the constitution *would* limit power, if the state obeyed it. Why would the state obey it?

The Democrats vowed **from the very start** that the ""Human Infrastructure"" bill better known as the Build-Back-Better bill would be passed by the Budgetary RECONCILIATION method - meaning passed in the Senate by ONLY the 50 Democratic Senators - to avoid the filibuster, to avoid amendment, to avoid changes, although the Senate Parliamentarian did make them remove certain things that did not meet the criteria of Budgetary changes.

Boring is right - as of today - nobody has gotten anything - but if the House just passed the Bi-partisan Infrastructure Bill, at least there would be something.

"Go look up Modern Monetary Theory, and you'll see that komrade GaryB was consistently arguing its ideas.  MMT is old-style monetary theory infused with a bunch of nonsensical Marxist claptrap.  

For example, one of the things he would often say was that it's impossible for the US to default or go bankrupt as long as it has the ability to print money, so deficit spending isn't a problem.  

Technically, it's true that a country that prints fiat money can't default.   \*But\*, to conclude that deficit spending isn't a problem, based on that, is sheer idiocy.  Drooling, brain-damaged lunacy.  

With too much debt, a country eventually has to print more money to pay off its creditors.  Creditors don't like that, because printing money is inflationary, and their risk increases dramatically, to the point where a positive return becomes questionable.  They stop investing, and the country then needs to print even more money to make their debt go away via inflation/devaluation of the currency.

Unfortunately, making their debt go away in this fashion also makes the savings and accumulated wealth of the country's citizens go away, too.  So, no, the US won't technically default/go bankrupt.  It'll just crash the world economy and leave all of its citizens penniless.

Oddly, that scenario is entirely consistent with Marxist revolution.

The net of all this?  Never trust a leftist economist.  Just like with Critical Race Theory, belief in leftist economic ideas requires a certain amount of ""abstraction.""
