#Child Tax Credit

Sen. Joe Manchin (D-WV) [reportedly](https://www.axios.com/scoop-manchins-red-lines-f9f5f7f7-56d8-4bf6-8345-13abb75ef03f.html) wants to impose an income cap and work requirement for the reconciliation bills child tax credit (CTC) in order to gain his support. A new [analysis](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/10/21/manchin-could-prevent-37-million-kids-from-getting-child-tax-credit.html) from the Niskanen Center, a moderate DC-based think-tank, found that Manchins $60k a year income cap would cut benefits from 37.4 million children, or 60% of the kids currently receiving the monthly payments.

&gt;In West Virginia, [170,000](https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2021/10/24/west-virginia-manchin-child-tax-credit/) children became newly eligible under the tax credit expansion, which was included in Bidens $1.9 trillion stimulus package passed in March. The changes to the tax credit raised the maximum benefit from $2,000 to $3,600 per child per year and dramatically expanded the share of poor families receiving the credit. In July, the food insecurity rate in West Virginia households with children dropped from 11.6 percent to 8.4 percent, and in September a survey found 86 percent of West Virginians felt the payments had made a huge difference.

* Manchins work requirement for child benefits would throw grandparent-led families under the bus, [WaPo](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2021/10/18/manchins-work-requirement-child-benefits-would-throw-grandparent-led-families-under-bus/).

* Biden says he does not support adding a work requirement to the child tax credit, [CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2021/10/21/politics/manchin-child-tax-credit-work-requirement/index.html).

#Climate change

A key provision in the reconciliation bill to fight climate change has been dropped due to the opposition of Sen. Joe Manchin...who just so happens to make millions from the fossil fuels industry. The Clean Electricity Performance Program (CEPP) would drive a transition to 100% clean electricity over the next 15 years by [rewarding](https://www.popsci.com/environment/clean-electricity-performance-program/) utilities that increase their share of clean electricity by 4% annually and charging a fee to those who dont.

Nearly all Senate Democrats appear to be on board with the program, supported by [66%](https://www.dataforprogress.org/blog/2021/9/30/voters-support-the-clean-electricity-performance-program) of voters, except for Manchin. According to his [spokesperson](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/15/climate/biden-clean-energy-manchin.html?partner=slack&amp;smid=sl-share), the Senator cant support using taxpayer dollars to pay private companies to do things theyre already doing. 

&gt;""The transition's already happening,"" Manchin told [CNN](https://edition.cnn.com/2021/10/19/politics/west-virginia-coal-rates-manchin-climate/index.html). ""So I'm not going to sit back and let anyone accelerate whatever the market's changes are doing.""

You may think he is simply advocating for his state, which is heavily reliant on coal, but West Virginians are paying a steep price:

&gt;The residential electricity rates of AEP's West Virginia subsidiaries have risen 122% over the last 13 years, from an average of $62.46 per month in 2008 to $138.57 per month in 2021& AEP's three coal-fired power plants in West Virginia -- John Amos, Mountaineer, and Mitchell -- are in need of $448 million worth of mandatory upgrades in order to remain federally compliant, causing electricity rates to increase by 3.3% starting in September 2022, according to Tammy Ridout, a spokesperson for AEP. These upgrades would allow the plants to stay open until 2040, rather than being shut down in 2028.

&gt;Kentucky and Virginia's public service commissions recently pulled their support from AEP's three West Virginia plants in need of upgrades, saying the plants are too expensive to support. But West Virginia's Public Service Commission recently ruled in favor of approving the upgrades to allow the plants to operate until 2040. ""The policy question here is whether it's appropriate for West Virginia ratepayers to pay more to keep uneconomical plants open,"" West Virginia House Delegate Evan Hansen told CNN. ""How many subsidies keep getting thrown at coal fired power plants to keep them open?""

The more likely explanation for Manchins stubborn resistance to clean energy is his bank account. Since he was elected to the Senate 11 years ago, Manchin has raked in over [$4.5 million](https://theintercept.com/2021/09/03/joe-manchin-coal-fossil-fuels-pollution/) from coal companies he founded. These firms have destroyed the local environment, sickened residents, and received numerous EPA and safety violations.

**Democrats are suggesting provisions to replace the CEPP but have not yet coalesced around a specific proposal.** One is keeping the incentive portion of the CEPP but getting rid of the fine for failing to switch over to clean electricity in the hopes of winning Manchins support. This approach risks losing progressive lawmakers, like Rep. Jared Huffman (D-CA):

&gt;Rep. Jared Huffman (D-Calif.), a member of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, [warned](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2021/10/21/key-senator-presented-an-alternative-power-plant-program-will-it-stick/) that any replacement to the CEPP must make significant progress toward President Bidens goal of reducing emissions at least 50 percent by 2030. You cant just throw money at any old thing and call it a deal, Huffman told The Climate 202 on Wednesday. So weve really got to replace it with something that provides comparable emission reductions in the power sector.

Another [alternative](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2021/10/16/white-house-climate-manchin/) under examination is a voluntary emissions trading system among aluminum, steel, concrete and chemicals manufacturers that would provide federal funding to help companies curb pollution. Its unclear how such a program would be structured. 

The White House is also exploring using different agencies to accomplish the same climate change goals:

&gt;A White House-backed clean power program that was rejected by Senator Joe Manchin could be resurrected as a grant program that would reward states that increase clean energy& The notion of using grants, which would require congressional funding through the spending bill being hashed out in Congress, dovetails with remarks made by Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm, who earlier this year said a national clean energy mandate could be done as a national contest between states if Congress doesnt go along with the plan&

&gt;There is a variety of discussions right now about how to have different authorities, different funding streams that can work in partnership with states, with utilities, with others in the private sector and local governments as well, [David Turk, the Energy Departments deputy secretary,] [told](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-10-20/state-grants-emerge-as-democrats-clean-power-plan-fallback?sref=Vi7wu7Hv) a Bloomberg Live event Tuesday.  There are a number of pathways here and those are the discussions we are having with key leaders on the Hill.

#Tax hike

The other roadblock in the Senate, Kyrsten Sinema (D-AZ) has taken issue with raising taxes to pay for the reconciliation bills social and climate programs. Democrats original plan included increasing the corporate tax rate and individual tax rate for high earners, partially undoing the 2017 GOP tax cuts under President Trump. Sinema reportedly opposes any tax hike, even on the super rich, despite voting against the GOP tax cuts. 

&gt;""She is committed to ensuring everyday families can get ahead and that we continue creating jobs,"" [Sinema spokesman John LaBombard [said](https://thehill.com/policy/finance/578102-sinemas-office-outlines-opposition-to-tax-rate-hikes)]. ""She has told her colleagues and the president that simply raising tax rates will not in any way address the challenge of tax avoidance or improve economic competitiveness.""

In order to pay for the bill and win Sinemas support, Democrats are working on alternative proposals like a targeted tax on billionaires:

&gt;Under the Billionaire Income Tax proposal, a summary of which was obtained by The [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/us-policy/2021/10/22/sinema-warren-billionaire-tax/), the federal government would require billionaires to pay taxes on the increased value of assets such as stocks on an annual basis, regardless of whether they sell those assets. Billionaires would also be able to take deductions for any annual loss in value of those assets.

&gt;The plan would also set up a system for taxing assets that are not easily tradable, such as real estate. The tax would apply to billionaires and people earning more than $100 million in income three years in a row.

Sinemas opposition to a broad tax increase on those making over $400,000 a year puts her at odds with most Americans: 68% support raising taxes on wealthy Americans and 62% say the same for raising the corporate tax rate, according to a Morning Consult [poll](https://morningconsult.com/2021/09/22/house-democrats-tax-plan-raising-taxes-wealthy-corporations-poll/).

#Drug pricing

Moderate House and Senate Democrats are also forcing their party to weaken their Medicare drug price negotiation plan, prompting some to despair that itd be better to drop the idea altogether:

&gt;Its been eviscerated, said Rep. Lloyd Doggett (D-Texas), who chairs the health subcommittee of House Ways and Means, and has pushed for aggressive drug price controls. At some point you have to ask: Is it worth it to pass it at all if its going to be some meaningless thing?

In its original form, the proposal would have given Medicare broad powers to bargain down the cost of hundreds of drugs, making them more affordable for all. The first sign of trouble came last month when three moderate Democrats on the House Energy and Commerce CommitteeReps. Scott Peters of California, Kathleen Rice of New York and Kurt Schrader of Oregon[joined](https://apnews.com/article/joe-biden-business-kamala-harris-kyrsten-sinema-joe-manchin-3f796484455ad3f36aea0da36ac3363a) with Republicans to drop the drug pricing language from a draft bill. 

Sen. Kyrsten Sinema has since joined the opposition group, according to unnamed sources cited by [Politico](https://www.politico.com/news/2021/09/19/kyrsten-sinema-biden-drug-pricing-prescription-plan-512907), despite [campaigning](https://www.accountable.us/news/report-sinema-abandoned-support-for-lowering-rx-drug-prices-after-flood-of-pharma-money-in-q3/) on lowering drug prices in 2018. 

&gt;During her 2018 Democratic primary campaign, Sinema [released](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/oct/11/big-pharma-has-a-powerful-new-shill-kyrsten-sinema-fighting-drug-price-reform) a direct-to-camera ad noting that her family had struggled with healthcare costs when she was younger. We need to make healthcare more affordable, with access to the lowest-cost prescriptions, and fix whats broken in the system, she said in the ad.

&gt;Sinemas 2018 campaign website featured similar language: Kyrsten is committed to making sure Arizonans have access to more health care choices, low-cost prescription drugs, and high-quality, dependable coverage. As one of the most independent-minded members of Congress, shes committed to working with anyone  regardless of party  to get it done.

The likely cause for her change of heart: a flood of money from pharmaceutical companies. During the 2019-2020 election cycle, Sinema [received](https://khn.org/news/a-senator-from-arizona-emerges-as-a-pharma-favorite/) nearly $100,000 from political action committees run by employees of drug companies and their trade groups.

&gt;That stands out in a Congress in which a third of the members got no pharma cash for the period and half of those who did got $10,000 or less. The contributions give companies a chance to cultivate Sinema as she restocks from a brutal 2018 election victory that cost nearly $25 million.

Her pharmaceutical haul since 2017 totals nearly [$400,000](https://www.opensecrets.org/members-of-congress/kyrsten-sinema/industries?cid=N00033983&amp;cycle=2022&amp;type=I).

&gt;The [slow progress](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2021/10/25/inside-phrma-fight-kill-democrats-drug-pricing-plan/) is in part due to an all-out lobbying campaign from the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, the drug industrys powerful trade group, to ensure nothing like the House proposal makes it into the reconciliation bill. PhRMA shelled out more than $22.4 million lobbying on drug pricing and other issues in the first nine months of the year, according to recent disclosure filings. And it has run TV ads warning the proposal will mean that politicians & decide which medicines you can and cant get.

&gt;...PhRMA appears mainly to have focused its efforts on lawmakers with concerns about House Democrats proposal. They include three House Democrats who opposed drug-pricing language in committee last month, and Sens. Tom Carper (D-Del.), Kyrsten Sinema (D-Ariz.) and Robert Menendez (D-N.J.).

#Other programs at risk

###Community College

Manchin has opposed a plan for tuition-free two-year community college education, saying he prefers making student loans forgivable. Let them earn it. Don't give it on the front end. Let them earn it on the back end, Manchin [said](https://rollcall.com/2021/06/16/proposed-education-spending-hike-faces-resistance-in-senate/).

Manchins position follows his stated belief that social spending leads to an entitlement society.

&gt;Im just not, so you know, I cannot accept our economy or basically our society moving toward an entitlement mentality. Im more of a rewarding, because I can help those who are going to need help if those who can help themselves do so.

A week later, he [criticized](https://news.yahoo.com/joe-manchin-says-bernie-sanders-022600466.html) Sen. Bernie Sanders (D-VT) approach to social spending: 

&gt;Ive been very clear when it comes to who we are as a society, who we are as a nation, Manchin said. I dont believe that we should turn our society into an entitlement society. I think we should still be a compassionate, rewarding society.

The tuition-free college plan has consequently been [dropped](https://www.cnn.com/2021/10/24/politics/pell-grant-free-community-college-biden/index.html) from the reconciliation bill.

###Paid leave

Manchin similarly is against the 12 weeks of paid leave, forcing Democrats to pare the time back to just four weeks or less. 

&gt;Asked Monday if he had concerns about the paid leave proposal, Manchin said: ""I'm concerned about an awful lot of things.""

Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY) is among those pushing Manchin to support more paid leave and was seen negotiating with him on Monday:

&gt;Im hoping to work with him on an employer, employee matching plan. Thats something hes very interested in and Im going to try to work with him on a plan that meets his area of interest, Gillibrand [told](https://twitter.com/mkraju/status/1452772779527483398?s=20) reporters&

###Medicare expansion

On Monday, Manchin told reporters that he opposes expanding Medicaid to cover hearing, dental, and vision care without first addressing insolvency ([clip](https://twitter.com/mkraju/status/1452692161707888643?s=20)):

""Medicare and Social Security is a lifeline for people back in West Virginia, most people around the country, and you've got to stabilize that first before you look at basically expansion. So, if we're not being fiscally responsible, that's really concerning...I've always said that I believe that government should be your best partner, but it shouldn't be your provider.""","Keep_Track",2285,2285,0,0.98,5,0,0,259

I recommend this jacobin article talking about the media coverage of the what is going on in the senate. Progressives are pushing for big social spending bill, and whilst most democrats have agreed to it, there are two especially corrupt moderates holding it back.

To even call them moderates when they are so blatantly corrupt is a national tragedy. Kyrsten Sinema is literally teaching a college course on [fundraising](https://theintercept.com/2021/10/08/kyrsten-sinema-fundraising-course-asu/). Joe manchin himself owns massive amounts of [shares in coal companies](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.businessinsider.com/senator-joe-manchin-half-million-year-coal-stocks-climate-crisis-2021-9%3famp). Whilst these details arent exactly secrets, Bernies conflicts with these two are rarely ever presented as what it is. Instead this is a personal ideological conflict and both sides should meet in the middle. Joe manchin isnt called out on tv every appearance, and kyrsten sinema doesnt get exposés on her financial dealings on tv. 

This is a perfect study on the neoliberal bias of the news networks. When Bernie called this abysmal coverage out he is scolding for it in CNN. In a more perfect world the media would be asking Biden why he hasnt already given the two remaining senators a whopping.","stupidpol",159,159,0,0.9,0,0,0,50

Biden has two bills he wants to pass:

* $1 Trillion in infrastructure
* $3.5 trillion for expanding healthcare, education, the child tax credit, and childcare.
* Both bills contain very mild measures to mitigate climate change.
* This spending is spread out over 10 years, or 450 Billion a year on average

Both bills are paid for by:

* Repurposing unused Covid stimulus funds
* ~~Mileage/road use taxes~~  Edit: Looks like this is not actually in the infrastructure bill, [just a study](https://apnews.com/article/fact-checking-907285011746)
* Raising the corporate tax rate from 21 to 26.5 or 28% (for context, it was 35 before the trump tax cuts)
* Raising the tax rate on the top tax bracket from 37 to 39%
* Effectively adding a new tax bracket of about 42% on income over $5 Million (""3% surcharge on incomes over $5M)
* Raising capital gains taxes
* There is some speculation as to whether this would cover the entire cost. If it doesn't though, we are talking about a 500-750 billion shortfall or 50-75 billion a year. Proponents say that economic growth would increase the estimated tax revenue enough to make this up.

Progressives (roughly 60 in the house and 11 in the senate, 26% of the party) wanted 6 trillion total, but said they would back both bills as-is providing both of them get passed. In fact, they have even said they are willing to go lower as long as conservative Dems provide a reasonable proposal.

All the Dems in between (150 in the house, 37 in the senate or 69.5%) are on-board with both bills.

Conservative Dems (Manchin, Sinema, and 10 house reps, or 4.5%) are the ones throwing a fit, even though their party's leader supports this bill. Their reasons are varied but they boil down to debt concerns (even though the bill is almost completely paid for), raising taxes (even though we're at one of the most unequal times in history and the tax increases are mostly just returning to pre-trump levels) and inflation (which is unlikely to accelerate given that the bills are paid for).

With the exception of Manchin and 1 of the house reps, none of these Dems have any reason to oppose the party's agenda since they all won their seats by 3 points or more in strong or leaning blue districts. You could maybe argue Sinema since Arizona is so split but her approval rating has tanked compared to her colleague Mark Kelly's.

To add to this, any alternatives seem to have been provided by house and senate leadership. Conservative Dems haven't provided any proposal other than ""I don't like it"". Manchin, who has the most reason to be a pain of any, is the only one to provide alternatives like reducing the number of years or means-testing.

I don't understand how CNN et al are treating centrists as some unmovable force of nature and progressives as the ones who are using their agency to derail these bills, when the centrists could just as easily back down and support the rest of the party that got them into power. 4.5% of the party is delaying the agenda of the other 95.5% and we're blaming the 26 % who is demanding we stick with it?

Edit: Both bills are extremely popular to boot. This is just one poll but still I think passing this will only help Dems, not hurt them.

By [**Paul Krugman**](https://archive.md/o/2FGE5/https://www.nytimes.com/by/paul-krugman) | *October 21, 2021*

Im not one of those liberals who believe that corporate greed is the root of all evil. Its the root of only some evil; there are other dark forces, especially white nationalism, stalking the U.S. body politic.

But corporate money is surely the villain behind the latest roadblock to President Bidens agenda: Senator Kyrsten Sinemas [opposition](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/20/us/politics/democrats-tax-rates.html) to any rollback to Donald Trumps big 2017 corporate tax cut.

After all, Sinema, who was in the House of Representatives at the time, voted [against](https://clerk.house.gov/Votes/2017699) that tax cut. And she [attacked](https://www.dailyposter.com/kyrsten-sinemas-tax-flip/) the tax cut the next year during her run for the Senate. Given that raising taxes on corporations has [overwhelming public support](https://www.vox.com/2021/10/15/22723457/build-back-better-poll-democrats-bill-infrastructure-taxes), its hard to see any reason for her flip other than the corporate [lobbying blitz](https://www.washingtonpost.com/us-policy/2021/08/31/business-lobbying-democrats-reconciliation/) against Build Back Better.

Its a distressing story. But heres what you need to know: While the Trump tax cut was bad and should be reversed, reclaiming the lost revenue isnt essential right now. If the key elements of the Biden agenda  investing in children and in protecting the planet against climate change  have to be paid for in part by borrowing, thats OK. It would certainly be better than not making those investments at all.

About that tax cut: The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act was [sold](https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/20210628_TPC_GaleHaldeman_TCJASupplySideEffectsReport_FINAL.pdf#page=3) with claims that a lower corporate tax rate would induce U.S. businesses to bring back money they had invested overseas, leading to a surge in business investment that would increase productivity and wages. This was a slightly more plausible story than the usual justification for tax cuts, the claim that they will give already rich people an incentive to work harder. But none of it happened.

On paper the tax cut act did seem, briefly, to cause a [repatriation of money](https://twitter.com/paulkrugman/status/1451137494238605315) to the United States. For a few quarters after the tax cut, U.S.-based multinationals reported that their overseas subsidiaries were disinvesting and sending their profits home via increased dividends paid to their parent companies. But this was a temporary blip, not a sustained change in behavior.

And theres no indication that the tax cut led to any increase in [business investment](https://blogs.imf.org/2019/08/08/us-business-investment-rising-market-power-mutes-tax-cut-impact/) here beyond what you would have expected given the economic situation.

The most plausible interpretation of the data is that cutting corporate taxes basically had no economic effect at all. While U.S. businesses report having invested large sums overseas, a lot of that is [phantom](https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/fandd/2019/09/the-rise-of-phantom-FDI-in-tax-havens-damgaard.htm) investment, an accounting fiction perpetrated to shift reported profits to low-tax jurisdictions like Ireland. A lower U.S. tax rate reduced the incentive to sustain this fiction, so some money was shifted back onto parent-company books. But nothing real actually happened.

So the Trump tax cut was just the latest in a long series of giveaways to the wealthy that were sold on false pretenses. And Sinema should be ashamed of herself for helping corporate interests perpetuate this grift.

That said, the Biden agenda doesnt need the revenue from a higher corporate tax rate.

The budget resolution that will make it possible to move forward on that agenda if Sinema and Senator Joe Manchin can be brought on board doesnt require that all investments in the future be fully paid for. In fact, it allows for up to [$1.75 trillion](https://www.crfb.org/blogs/senate-budget-resolution-would-allow-175-trillion-borrowing) in borrowing. And if opposition from the corporate wing of the Democratic Party  can we stop calling them moderates?  prevents tax increases, better to borrow than not to invest.

Should we be worried that increased borrowing would threaten U.S. solvency? No. The interest rate on long-term federal debt is only about [1.65 percent](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/DGS10), so even adding $1.75 trillion in debt would mean only about $30 billion added to annual interest costs  0.15 percent of [gross domestic produc](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/GDP)t, which is trivial.

And even this calculation greatly overstates the true debt burden, which should be calculated using the real, that is, inflation-adjusted, interest rate  which is [negative](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/DFII10).

What about concerns that deficit-financed spending might be [inflationary](https://www.wsj.com/articles/manchin-pelosi-biden-3-5-trillion-reconciliation-government-spending-debt-deficit-inflation-11630605657)? Again, its important to do the math. If the U.S. were to end up borrowing another $1.75 trillion, that would be over the course of a decade, not a single year  and the Congressional Budget Office projects total G.D.P. over the next decade of [$288 trillion](https://www.cbo.gov/system/files/2021-07/57218-Outlook.pdf#page=2). So while it might sound as if were talking about huge deficit spending, the additional deficit would be only 0.6 percent of G.D.P., which simply isnt a big deal.

In fact, given the arithmetic you might wonder why Biden ever wanted to raise taxes enough to fully pay for his investment agenda. The answer, I think, was more about the politics than the economics  that pitching his plans as deficit-neutral was supposed to reassure politicians who havent caught up with [current mainstream economic thinking](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/19/upshot/deficit-public-debt-debate.html), and who still regard budget deficits as a major threat.

At this point, however, it looks as if a final budget deal, if there is one, will have to involve substantial borrowing. And thats OK. We can deplore the corporate influence that may block some justified tax increases, but borrowing to invest for the future isnt a bad thing in itself. Hey, businesses do it all the time. So Democrats should just go for it.","neoliberal",47,47,0,0.86,0,0,0,34

Therefore it should be concluded that liberals are not rational people.","The axiom in question is that every individual, and the individual alone, is responsible for their actions and the resulting outcomes. If you accept this axiom that means you accept the system that supports liberalism is never at fault, by default. However, because any critique of capitalism as a system necessarily requires criticism of the axiomatic assumptions capitalism makes, that means all critiques hold systems accountable. This is a dialectical conundrum. From the capitalist perspective the system can not be blamed for the individual actions taken within capitalism therefore capitalism can't be at fault when bad people do bad things, however socialism can be held accountable because it is a critique of the idea that the individual alone is responsible. Meanwhile from a socialist perspective material conditions and systemically incentivized actions are major points of discussion.

To put this another way; when Joe Manchin is both responsible for the climate change bill and holds stock in the fossil fuel industry the socialist would say Joe Manchin has as an outside influence that would cause him to perhaps write a subpar bill. The capitalist would put all the blame on Joe Manchin, and none on the system that allows him to have contradictory incentives. When a company like Nestle is found to be using literal slave labor, the capitalist would just say Nestle is doing a bad thing and leave it at that. The socialist would say that the profit motive incentivizes lowering the cost production and that you likely could not find labor cheaper than slavery, therefore the system incentivizes slave labor and both can be at fault.

Notice how one side has nuanced reasoning and wants to address systemic failures, while the other just shifts blame away from the system and onto the individual. Liberalism is slave mentality, cultish behavior, and requires an unearned trust in the system. Never has a liberal said anything worth considering in regards to politics, because they default to protecting the system at all costs. They are an irrational hivemind of credit ghouls.","CapitalismVSocialism",0,0,0,0.39,0,0,0,57

Those two provisions are just a part of the wide-ranging social-policy and climate bill [Democrats are attempting to craft](https://archive.md/o/CJDRm/https://www.wsj.com/articles/democrats-face-a-deadline-on-safety-net-and-climate-bill-consensus-11634468400?mod=article_inline) in the next few weeks. Initially set to cost $3.5 trillion, Mr. Biden is now trying to rally the progressive and moderate wings of the party around a new framework with a price tag of around $2 trillion. Some lawmakers said they were optimistic Democrats could reach a deal by the end of the week. After the meetings concluded White House press secretary Jen Psaki said there was broad agreement that there is urgency in moving forward over the next several days and that the window for finalizing a package is closing.

Mr. Biden met with both a group of progressive House Democrats and moderate Democrats. He also held two individual meetings with Sens. Kyrsten Sinema (D., Ariz.) and Mr. Manchin, pivotal centrists in the 50-50 Senate.

Democrats have differed over [how to trim the size of the package](https://archive.md/o/CJDRm/https://www.wsj.com/articles/democrats-weigh-cutting-programs-or-reducing-scope-to-trim-3-5-trillion-bill-11633273309?mod=article_inline), with progressives pushing for the party to reduce the duration of many of the bills different programs and preserve them all, even if just for a short duration. Centrists and top House Democrats have favored focusing resources on a smaller number of programs for the long term.

Democrats said that Mr. Biden endorsed the progressive approach during the meetings on Tuesday.

I think he is with us that we need to invest in as many of those transformational areas as possible, even if it means for some of them a shorter amount of time, Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D., Wash), the chairwoman of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, said. 

I favor the other approach, I think we should have few programs that we do well but the reality is weve got a math problem, said Rep. Mike Thompson (D., Calif.), who attended the meeting with moderate Democrats. I think shorter duration is whats going to be.

Mr. Biden indicated to Democrats that the [compromise would include universal prekindergarten](https://archive.md/o/CJDRm/https://www.wsj.com/articles/bidens-pre-k-proposal-faces-questions-over-federal-role-11625572800?mod=article_inline), according to several people familiar with the discussion, though the funding for other programs could be cut. Democrats have discussed reducing the number of weeks covered under a proposed federal paid-leave program, which would offer 12 weeks of leave as currently drafted. 

Mr. Biden said that the White House would base any possible income cutoffs for eligibility for new programs on median state incomes, according to Mr. Thompson. 

More broadly, some lawmakers said Mr. Biden implied that the bills total spending wasnt likely to top $1.9 trillion, on the low end of the range that he had previously floated to them. But others left with the impression that the programs under discussion were still in the $1.9 trillion to $2.2 trillion range, according to lawmakers and aides.

On Capitol Hill, where top progressives and centrists have met in recent days, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D., N.Y.) said that Democrats would aim to reach an agreement on the contours of the legislation by the end of the week. White House officials and some Democrats on Capitol Hill said they were becoming more optimistic that the party could soon unify behind a proposal.

Overall, almost every priority is included, Rep. Ro Khanna (D., Calif.) said of the package discussed at Tuesdays White House meeting. 

Mr. Manchin said a deal by the end of the week was possible. 

Democrats are racing to make progress on the social policy and climate bill by the end of the month, when House Democrats are hoping to pass a separate, roughly $1 trillion infrastructure bill. Progressives have insisted on moving the two pieces of legislation together, making an agreement on the social-policy and climate bill a [politically necessary precondition of passing](https://archive.md/o/CJDRm/https://www.wsj.com/articles/democrats-try-again-to-pass-infrastructure-bill-11633097276?mod=article_inline) the public works bill.

At the same time, Mr. Bidens senior advisers hope the president can arrive at a [pivotal international climate-change meeting](https://archive.md/o/CJDRm/https://www.wsj.com/articles/glasgow-climate-summit-faces-high-risk-of-failure-u-n-leader-says-11632166025?mod=article_inline) in Glasgow that begins on Oct. 31 having made progress in the congressional negotiations. The president stressed to Democrats on Tuesday that he would like to see significant progress on the package before the Glasgow summit, arguing that the international meeting offered the U.S. an opportunity to show the world that Washington isnt hopelessly dysfunctional.

The president was pretty clear that hed like to have this hammered out before he goes off to Scotland, said Rep. Ami Bera (D., Calif.), who attended the meeting of more centrist Democrats.

Much of the negotiation has focused on earning the support of Mr. Manchin, who has said he supports $1.5 trillion in spending. His opposition to a central climate-change-related provision in the package has [prompted lawmakers to reconsider](https://archive.md/o/CJDRm/https://www.wsj.com/articles/democrats-lean-toward-dropping-clean-electricity-plan-from-budget-package-11634353044?mod=article_inline) the bills climate efforts. 

Democrats had designed the clean-electricity performance program to provide grants to utilities that increase the amount of clean electricity they generate by at least 4% a year, while penalizing utilities that dont meet that standard. Mr. Manchin has argued that utilities shouldnt receive federal funds for an energy transition they are already making.

Rep. Jared Huffman (D., Calif.), who attended Mr. Bidens meeting with progressives, said he was concerned that Democrats would fall short of Mr. Bidens emissions-reduction goals without the clean energy program. Mr. Biden indicated he was looking at alternatives, he said.

The president said he stands by that goal for emissions reductions and would continue the conversation at a higher level of detail, Mr. Huffman said. 

Among those alternatives are a tax on carbon emissions. But some key Democrats expressed skepticism about a carbon tax, making adoption of the proposal unlikely. I dont see how it works and is equitable, Sen. Jon Tester (D., Mont.) said, taking issue with a proposal to reimburse the tax back to the public at a flat rate. The carbon tax isnt on the board at all right now, said Mr. Manchin.

Some Democrats are discussing polluter fees; others want Mr. Biden to declare a climate emergency and unilaterally establish policies to cut carbon emissions.

Democrats are using a process called budget reconciliation to try to pass the bill with just a simple majority, rather than the 60 votes usually required to advance legislation in the 50-50 Senate. Because Republicans have lined up against the bill, calling it wasteful and a threat to the economy, Democrats will need the support of every member in the Senate.

While Democrats are working toward a slimmed-down framework for their social-spending bill, a priority many of them had from the start  significant investments in combating the climate crisis  looks like it might make the cut.

&gt;It would help with child-raising expenses, from birth to college  
&gt;  
&gt;The megabill would have the federal government do far  more to support parents, providing money or establishing new programs  related to child care, pre-K, community college, and more.   
&gt;  
&gt;For all of these, the exact details about how they will  work remain to be determined and are subject to change, but Democrats  have indicated they would spend large sums of money on each of these  priorities:  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;**Paid leave**: Currently, the federal government does not guarantee paid leave for working parents. Some [states require it](https://www.kff.org/womens-health-policy/fact-sheet/paid-family-leave-and-sick-days-in-the-u-s/), and some employers voluntarily offer it  but [small businesses](https://www.kff.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/8949-05-Figure-3.png) and [employers with few high-wage workers](https://www.kff.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/8949-05-Figure-4.png)  are less likely to do so. So the megabill would create a national paid  leave program, in which the government would pay part of a workers  salary for up to 12 weeks of leave (for new parents or other issues,  such as serious illness). As [Matt Yglesias wrote earlier this year](https://www.slowboring.com/p/families-plan#footnote-anchor-2),  under Bidens plan the governments share of these leave payments would  be capped at $4,000 a month, so in practice, this would be most useful  for low-wage workers.   
&gt;  
&gt;**Child care subsidies**: The bill would also try to help  low- and middle-income families with the cost of child care. Basically,  if you earn below a certain amount, the federal government would help  foot the bill for your child care  subsidizing it so that costs wont  exceed a certain percentage of your income. Many details remain to be  worked out here, particularly Bidens [promise](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/04/28/fact-sheet-the-american-families-plan/) that the resulting child care will be high quality, which seems more challenging to implement.  
&gt;  
&gt;**Funding pre-K**: In much of the US, public schooling  starts at age 5, with kindergarten, and many parents of 3- and  4-year-olds dont have a government-funded option for pre-K. The bill  would try to change this, allotting [hundreds of millions of dollars](https://www.politico.com/newsletters/weekly-education/2021/08/02/senate-mulls-a-path-to-universal-pre-k-796857) for preschool expansion. This implementation would again have to happen at the state and local levels.  
&gt;  
&gt;**Summer lunches for low-income children**: Currently,  low-income children can get free lunch at school, and Democrats want to  extend that benefit to cover the summer when school is out  another  anti-poverty measure.  
&gt;  
&gt;**Free community college**: The bill would fund [Bidens plan](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/07/22/what-bidens-free-community-college-plan-would-cost-and-save-americans.html) to cover two years of free community college to those who want it.  
&gt;  
&gt;**Expanded Pell grants**: Low-income students who rely on Pell grants to help pay for college would get extra help under this bill.  
&gt;  
&gt;Its a health care bill, especially for seniors  
&gt;  
&gt;Even after Obamacare extended health insurance to  millions more Americans, major gaps in the USs system and the benefits  it provides remain  gaps that frequently expose Americans to burdensome  and even ruinous expenses. This years megabill is expected to fill  several of those gaps:  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;**Medicare expansion to cover dental, vision, and hearing**:  The megabill would expand Medicare to cover dental, vision, and hearing  benefits (which are mostly or entirely not covered in standard Medicare  plans), meaning it could be a huge help to [seniors who incur those expenses](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/09/business/medicare-dental-work-bill.html). The budget resolution also would allow for [lowering the eligibility age](https://www.axios.com/dems-medicare-expansion-infrastructure-sanders-5a085562-efbc-4f7d-8747-dc77ef6c0ec2.html) for Medicare, but it is unclear at this point whether this will make it into the eventual bill.  
&gt;  
&gt;**Medicare drug price negotiation**: Democrats also plan to empower Medicare to negotiate with the federal government on [prescription drug pricing](https://www.wsj.com/articles/democrats-split-over-measures-to-cut-drug-prices-11625662801),  something that would drive prices down for seniors. It has the added  benefit of driving costs down for the federal government, which would  help pay for the megabills new spending.  
&gt;  
&gt;**Long-term care**: Democrats also hope to spend hundreds  of billions of dollars on long-term care for seniors and people with  disabilities who need daily assistance. As [Jonathan Cohn writes](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/home-care-elderly-disabilities-dingell_n_60f4381ae4b01ba8eed71236), more than 800,000 Americans are on waiting lists for home and community-based care services right now, due to lack of funding.  
&gt;  
&gt;**Medicaid expansion**: There are still [12 states](https://www.kff.org/medicaid/issue-brief/status-of-state-medicaid-expansion-decisions-interactive-map/) that have not implemented Obamacares [expansion of Medicaid](https://www.vox.com/2015/1/27/18088994/medicaid-expansion-explained) to more low-income people, and Democrats have committed to ensuring they get coverage in this bill  though theyre [still debating](https://www.politico.com/news/2021/07/10/obamacare-medicaid-coverage-gap-democrats-499013) how, exactly, to do it.  
&gt;  
&gt;**Affordable Care Act subsidies**: Finally, Democrats also [intend to make](https://www.kff.org/health-reform/issue-brief/how-the-american-rescue-plan-act-affects-subsidies-for-marketplace-shoppers-and-people-who-are-uninsured/)  temporary, pandemic-inspired expansions in subsidies for people getting  health care on Obamacares individual marketplaces permanent.  
&gt;  
&gt;Its a climate, housing, and immigration bill  for now, at least  
&gt;  
&gt;Democrats are also using this bill as the vehicle for  their climate change agenda. The catch is that the bill will have to win  the approval of coal-state Sen. Joe Manchin, so dont expect a frontal  assault on fossil fuels. But Democrats remain hopeful that measures to  support clean energy can win Manchin over.   
&gt;  
&gt;Current plans are to include:  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;**A clean electricity payment program**: The marquee  climate policy in this bill would be a call for 80 percent of the USs  electricity to be generated by clean sources by 2030, [according to E&amp;E News](https://www.eenews.net/articles/manchin-could-get-top-role-in-writing-clean-energy-standard/).  The bill likely cant directly mandate this due to restrictions in the  reconciliation process. But it will try to achieve it by [making payments](https://www.eenews.net/articles/payments-or-fines-how-dems-ces-would-affect-utilities/) to utilities that rely on clean energy, while fining those that arent making progress toward reducing carbon emissions, as [my colleague Rebecca Leber recently explained](https://www.vox.com/22579218/clean-energy-standard-electricity-infrastructure-democrats). Manchin will play a big role in crafting this, as he chairs the key Senate committee that will be involved.  
&gt;  
&gt;**Clean energy tax incentives and research money**: Renewable energy industries like wind and solar would get [big tax breaks](https://www.wsj.com/articles/democrats-budget-would-finance-sweeping-clean-energy-plan-11626620401), and a clean energy accelerator [would be funded](https://www.axios.com/climate-provisions-senate-democrats-budget-proposal-016cce3b-9fb9-48c2-bf3e-73822484f8c0.html) to support new technologies.   
&gt;  
&gt;**Polluter import fee and methane polluter fee**: The idea for an outright carbon tax is [long dead](https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2021/07/obituary-carbon-tax-beloved-climate-policy-dies-47/619507/), but Democrats have [proposed](https://www.rollcall.com/2021/07/15/in-reconciliation-democrats-eye-border-tax-for-carbon/)  putting tariffs on imported goods from countries with weaker  restrictions on carbon emissions, and putting a price on methane  emissions (which [heavily contribute](https://www.edf.org/climate/methane-crucial-opportunity-climate-fight) to climate change).  
&gt;  
&gt;Other issues the bill may tackle:  
&gt;  
&gt;**Housing:** Democrats plan to allot  hundreds of billions of dollars more for affordable housing, with money  going to rental assistance and homeownership initiatives, as well as the  creation and preservation of affordable housing.  
&gt;  
&gt;**Immigration**: Finally, though details  remain scarce, Democrats are currently saying they intend to include in  the megabill a path to legal status for some undocumented immigrants.  Sen. Bob Menendez (D-NJ) [told NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/immigration/democrats-pursue-ambitious-immigration-changes-3-5-trillion-budget-measure-n1274095) last month this would apply to some of each of the following categories: those [who came here as children](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/8/31/16226934/daca-trump-dreamers-immigration), farmworkers, people with [Temporary Protected Status](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2021/3/8/22319875/venezuela-tps-temporary-protected-status-biden), and essential workers.

President Joe Biden heads to a vital U.N. climate summit at a time when a majority of Americans regard the deteriorating climate as a problem of high importance to them, an increase from just a few years ago

About 6 out of 10 Americans also believe that the pace of global warming is speeding up, according to a new survey from the Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research and the Energy Policy Institute at the University of Chicago.

Only 16% of Americans oppose such a measure for electricity from cleaner energy. A similar measure initially was one of the most important parts of climate legislation that Biden has before Congress. But Bidens proposal to reward utilities with clean energy sources and penalize those without ran into objections from a coal-state senator, Democrat Joe Manchin of West Virginia, leaving fellow Democrats scrambling to come up with other ways to slash pollution from burning fossil fuels.

For some of the Americans watching, its an exasperating delay in dealing with an urgent problem.

If you follow science, the signs are here,  said Nancy Reilly, a Democrat in Missouri whos retired after 40 years as a retail manager, and worries for her children as the climate deteriorates. Its already here.

Its just maddening,  Reilly said. I understand why, I do  I get the politics of it. Im sick of the politics of it.

After President Donald Trump pulled the United States out of the Paris climate accord, the Biden administration hoped to help negotiate major emissions cuts globally to slow the rise of temperatures. But its not clear whether Biden will be able to get any significant climate legislation through Congress before the U.N. summit starts Sunday.

**Little known fact: When youre building back better it is customary to have no fucking clue what the blueprints say until its time for the groundbreaking.** Fortunately, Democrats are beating that standard. Kinda.                          
                 
- The short version of [the story](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/25/us/politics/biden-democrats-reconciliation-bill.html) is that Sens. Joe Manchin (D-WV) and Kyrsten Sinema (D-AZ) continue raising objections to various provisions of the Build Back Better Act, but its unclear how completely Democratic leaders are caving to their demands, and theres some indication that other, frustrated Democrats have begun to push back.                          
                 
- [First, the annoying part](https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2021/10/26/biden-reconciliation-medicare-medicaid-congress/). Manchin doesnt want to expand Medicare benefits to include vision and dental care because he says thats too expensive, and doesnt want to close the Medicaid coverage gap in red states that rejected the ACAs Medicaid expansion, because itd be unfair to West Virginia, which participated in and paid for a small part of that reform.                          
                 
- Manchin also reportedly wants to [kill the plans proposed fee on methane emissions](https://twitter.com/drvolts/status/1452756235002908674?s=20), which would remove the last greenhouse-gas disincentive from the bill, and says he [opposes](https://twitter.com/elwasson/status/1453021874154360833?s=21) a [provision that would cut down on tax-cheating by wealthy filers](https://www.washingtonpost.com/us-policy/2021/10/18/democrats-irs-bank-reporting/) by expanding bank-reporting requirements to the IRS. Between that and Sinemas reported objections to any tax-rate increases, the duo have made paying for the bill a greater challenge than it should be.                          
                 
**All of this underscores the most important reason for Dems to announce a deal:** So we can say for certain wtf is going on!                          
                 
- For instance: Influential Democrats like Rep. Jim Clyburn (D-SC) and Sen. Raphael Warnock (D-GA)both of whom represent non-expansion statessay theyre pushing Manchin on a workaround for the Medicaid coverage gap. Sen. Tina Smith (D-MN) [says the methane fee is still on the table](https://talkingpointsmemo.com/live-blog/democrats-huddle-as-caucus-ascertains-whatll-happen-this-week?entry=1392145). And Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) [says](https://twitter.com/mkraju/status/1453015114014203926?s=20) the final bill must include the Medicare expansion and a provision allowing Medicare to negotiate prescription-drug prices downward.                          
                 
- If Sanders sticks to his guns, a prescription-drug pricing provision would raise hundreds of billions of dollars to pay for the rest of the bill all by itself. Sinema also reportedly seems interested (somehow???) in taxing billionaire assets. Shes been working with Sen.

**[Virginia Democrats sued the U.S. Postal Service on Friday](https://www.cnn.com/2021/10/23/politics/virginia-democrats-postal-service-election-related-material-delays/index.html), in a chilling reminder that the same guy who tried to sabotage the mail to help Donald Trump win re-election is still running the post office under President Biden.** Democrats contend that postal-service delays (which, as you may recall, Trumpy Postmaster Louis DeJoy has engineered on purpose) threaten to disenfranchise thousands of voters from predominantly Democratic leaning counties. The suit alleges that ""Thousands of ballots delivered to postal facilities by the general registrars weeks ago are still outstanding and, weeks later, have not yet even been scanned into USPS's system, and paints the following nightmare scenario: Even if these voters do eventually receive their ballots before Election Day, the slowdowns promise that they will not have sufficient time to send them back with assurance that they will arrive in time to be counted. And even if a ballot reaches the appropriate election official before the receipt deadline, if the official identifies any issues with it that require remediation before it may be counted, the voter will have run out of time to rectify the problem."" Among other things, Democrats have asked the court to order USPS to prioritize and process election mail, and deliver it all within three days.

But the ad doesnt mention a few things: 1) Murphy is a Republican activist; 2) the book she wanted to veto was *Beloved* by Toni Morrison, a classic work of literature; 3) she intervened to create a safe space for her son because *Beloved* (which millions of people have read without incident) gave him night terrors; 4) [she discussed this all with the *Washington Post* back in 2013](https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/education/fairfax-county-parent-wants-beloved-banned-from-school-system/2013/02/07/99521330-6bd1-11e2-ada0-5ca5fa7ebe79_story.html); 5) her dweeb son went on to become a lawyer for the House GOPs election committee, and a clerk in the Trump White House.

**Late Sedition**
------------------------------------------------------------------------
**The window of plausible deniability is closing on the most powerful Republicans in the country over their involvement in the attempted coup and violent insurrection.** Merrick Garland, your office has been on line one for nine months.                          
                 
- The *Washington Post* [ran an exposé over the weekend](https://www.washingtonpost.com/investigations/willard-trump-eastman-giuliani-bannon/2021/10/23/c45bd2d4-3281-11ec-9241-aad8e48f01ff_story.html) about the so-called command center Trump loyalists led by Rudy Giuliani set up at the Willard Hotel in Washington, DC, just down the street from the White House. In the days leading up to the Capitol riot, it served as the central organizing hub for efforts to strongarm GOP state officials into overturning their election results, and creating the strategy, outlined in the infamous Eastman memo, whereby Vice President Mike Pence would refuse to certify Joe Bidens victory. These plotters spent tens of thousands of dollars on hotel rooms, which they billed to the Trump campaign.                          
                 
- Many of the same Trump allies and elected officials who helped organize, finance, and advance the procedural planning for the failed coup were also intimately involved in planning the Stop the Steal rally outside the White House on January 6. In an explosive new report, [*Rolling Stone* sources involved in the planning and organizing of that rally say](https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/exclusive-jan-6-organizers-met-congress-white-house-1245289/) they participated in dozens of planning briefings with GOP members of Congress and their staffs, and that they were even bribed with promises of blanket pardons. They are reportedly prepared to testify about it all to the January 6 committee.                          
                 
- If theres a fig leaf left for the seditious nethers of the Trump world, its the artificial claim that they couldnt possibly have known a splinter faction of rallygoers would get violent. But that excuse seems to be falling apart, too. On January 5, Steve Bannon [said](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/21/us/politics/bannon-contempt-jan-6-subpoena.html) all hell is going to break loose tomorrow and has just been referred to the Justice Department for defying a congressional subpoena for testimony about how much he and Donald Trump knew about plans for January 6. Furthermore, the *Rolling Stone* sources say senior administration officials, including Mark Meadows, had opportunities to prevent the mob at the Capitol from becoming violent, but did notand we can all remember Trump and others reacting with glee in real time to footage of the violence.                          
                 
**As a fuller picture of the last insurrection comes into focus,** so does planning for the next one, unfortunately.                          
                 
- Gov. Greg Abbott (R-TX) [has appointed a pro-insurrection lawyer as Texass secretary of state](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/21/us/texas-governor-secretary-of-state.html). John Scott represented Trump in a lawsuit aimed at overturning Pennsylvanias election results. Under a recent order from Abbott (who in turn took orders from Trump) Scott will oversee another sham audit/propaganda blitz in the state, which Trump won by over five points, and (more importantly) will also oversee draconian new voter-suppression laws when voters head to the polls for next years midterms.                          
                 
- The erosion of voting rights, and the steady march of election-subversion tactics, understandably has Democratic voters in GOP-run swing states spooked. [In Georgia, activists are daunted](https://www.politico.com/news/2021/10/24/georgia-democrats-fear-angst-516931) by the likelihood that Democrats in Congress wont pass democracy-protection legislation, and will thus have to out-organize voter suppression. Against that backdrop, President Biden endorsed changing filibuster rules to advance the Freedom to Vote Act for the first time last week.                          
                 
**The right-wing threat to democracy presents a challenge to the entire center-left.** Its on Merrick Garland to prosecute people whose coup-plotting veered into criminal territory, or who defy congressional subpoenas. And its up to elected Democrats to expose the whole plot and secure the next election. It cant fall on voters shoulders alone.

- [Heres a story](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/10/22/jan-6-capitol-riot-facebook/) about how Facebook lifted limits on election-related misinformation after November, contributing to the spread of lies that culminated in the January 6 insurrection; and about how the company has known how to reduce disinformation and violence incitement but has frequently chosen not to do so.                          
                 
- [Heres a story](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/10/25/mark-zuckerberg-facebook-whistleblower/) about how Mark Zuckerberg overruled staffers who wanted to create a Spanish-language voting-information resource for WhatsApp users, because he thought it would look partisan.

Saudi Arabia is joining the net-zero club, with plans to go carbon neutral by 2060. Neighboring Bahrain will also join the pledge, while Kuwait will be involved with the Saudi commitment. While the Kingdom's framework aligns with China and Russia, the time frame falls short of other large economies like the U.S., U.K., and EU, which all are targeting net-zero by 2050.

Caveat: The promise doesn't include emissions from the massive amounts of oil Saudi Arabia exports around the globe (it pumps one in 10 barrels of oil consumed each day). It will also allow the Saudis to continue burning fossil fuels for decades to come, as well as invest in new oil-and-gas development. Instead, the Kingdom plans on reaching its net-zero target by cutting emissions of methane (30% by 2030) and creating a ""carbon circular economy,"" which includes carbon capture, utilization and storage technologies.

""This protects the leading role of the Kingdom in strengthening the security and stability of global energy markets, in light of the maturity and availability of the necessary technologies to manage and reduce emissions,"" Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman said during a speech at the Saudi Green Initiative forum, which comes just days before the COP26 climate meeting in Glasgow, Scotland.

Go deeper: Saudi Energy Minister Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman has also argued that 2050 targets (like those set by the IEA) would cut supply before global demand drops significantly. That can risk a heavy oil price spike and burdening economies that are overly dependent on importing/exporting oil and gas. Some have even called the most recent price spike the first major energy crisis of the clean power transition, with the Biden administration calling on OPEC+ to increase oil production as crude hit multi-year highs and Russia offering to export record volumes of vital fuel to the EU.

Carbon offsets?

Many companies are turning to carbon offsets to help meet their ""net-zero"" pledges, but tallying that data can be tricky. It gets even more complicated with regulatory reporting requirements of greenhouse-gas emissions, which are increasingly being seen in Europe and the U.S. Already, the SEC is working on a potential climate-disclosure regulation and some 90% of companies in the S&amp;P 500 currently produce sustainability reports.

Quote: ""You have people saying some of these things [carbon offsets] are rubbish and other people say no, they're really important,"" said Thomas Lingard, Unilever's sustainability director. ""It's super confusing to people and that cant be the desired state for a world that is rapidly trying to deal with the climate crisis."" Another job for the COP26?

Currently, the most widely-used international framework is the Greenhouse Gas Protocol, which divides emissions into three categories. Those resulting from company operations are called Scope 1, while those resulting from energy the company buys are dubbed Scope 2. The most difficult ones to calculate are Scope 3, which are emissions that are related to a company's product, but are produced by suppliers and customers.

Outlook: Prices for carbon offsets vary widely, ranging from a few dollars for credits linked to conserving grasslands, to thousands of dollars for capturing carbon to store in the ground. Their unclear structure also compounds the issues for businesses, regulators and investors to size up the effectiveness of projects that generate offset credits. According to Morningstar Direct, more than $51B flowed into sustainable funds in 2020, notching more than a quarter of overall U.S. fund flows and doubling the 2019 record.

Deal in sight

Democrats are getting closer to finalizing an agreement on Biden's economic agenda that would allow for a bipartisan infrastructure bill to move forward. ""We have 90% of the bill agreed to and written, we just have some of the last decisions to be made,"" House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said on CNN's State of the Union. The social spending measure previously stalled in the Senate due to objections from West Virginia's Joe Manchin and Arizona's Kyrsten Sinema, who cited concerns about hefty expenditures.

By the numbers: What had been a sweeping $3.5T plan is now being looked at as a $1.75T package, according to sources, but that figure may go higher.

Manchin appears to be on board with White House proposals for new taxes on billionaires and certain corporations. Earlier, the White House has floated a 15% minimum corporate tax rate that's designed to ensure all companies pay what President Biden calls their ""fair share."" If an agreement is reached by the week's end, a House vote on a separate $1T bipartisan infrastructure bill could happen before Sunday, when a series of transportation programs expire (Biden also heads to Glasgow at the end of the week).

Quote: ""It is less than what was projected to begin with, but it's still bigger than anything we have ever done in terms of addressing the needs of America's working families,"" Pelosi continued. ""I think were pretty much there now, it's just the language of it.""

Transitory thesis

The inflation debate heated up over the weekend after Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) CEO Jack Dorsey weighed in on price pressures. ""Hyperinflation is going to change everything. Its happening,"" he wrote. ""It will happen in the US soon, and so the world."" To another reply, he tweeted that it is ""Not a wish. Nor do I think its positive at all.""

Snapshot: Inflation is one of the biggest concerns for the economic recovery and the stock market, while the Federal Reserve recently shifted its strategy to allow higher inflation for longer to recover (flexible average inflation targeting, or FAIT). It argues that the recent spikes, with core CPI at 4% year-on-year, are transitory, though Fed Chair Jay Powell said this week they could last well into next year.

Former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers, who served under the Clinton administration, has also been making waves, ramping up the warnings about the effects that spending is having on inflation. ""I think he's wrong. I don't think we're about to lose control of inflation,"" current Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said on Sunday morning. ""On a 12-month basis, the inflation rate will remain high into next year because of what's already happened. But I expect improvement... by the middle to end of next year, second half of next year.""

Bottom line: Prices have also spiked up due to supply chain disruptions and labor shortages as demand increases with the reopening of the economy. In the latest job openings and labor turnover report released earlier this month, there were more than 10M job openings in August, and a record 2.9% of workers quit their jobs. (106 comments)

The White House is zeroing in on a package of clean energy strategies for President Joe Bidens big domestic policy bill that officials believe could reach similar greenhouse gas emission reduction goals as an initial proposal that was quashed by opposition

The Biden administration discussed the proposals Monday at the White House with the leaders of about a dozen environmental and justice groups, according to a senior administration official who requested anonymity to share the plans. A new approach was needed after coal-state Sen. Joe Manchin, [D-W.Va](https://D-W.Va). rejected the White Houses earlier clean energy plan.

The emerging proposals would expand grants and loans in the agriculture and industrial sectors to help them shift to clean energy providers with fewer greenhouse gas emissions that contribute to global warming, the official said. There would also be new, refundable home improvement tax credits for tapping solar, wind and other renewable energy sources. The official said momentum was building as the group coalesced around the new ideas.

The new strategies come as the president and Democrats in Congress are struggling to wrap up talks on Bidens now-scaled-back package of at least $1.75 trillion in social services and climate change investments before he departs later this week for two global summits overseas.

Vice President Kamala Harris visited the afternoon meeting with the leaders of some of the nations leading environmental and justice organizations and reiterated the presidents commitment to the goals of the package  even as she acknowledged the sometimes grueling process to achieve consensus in the party.

The president and I and our administration are unwavering in our commitment to these issues. Absolutely unwavering,  she said. But you know, theres an old saying, you dont want to watch sausage be made and you dont want to watch a bill being made.

&gt; Oct 27 - Democratic Senator Joe Manchin has leveraged his party&amp;#039;s slim majority in Congress to reshape President Joe Biden&amp;#039;s spending bill, slashing its initial price tag of $3.5 trillion and blocking policy proposals on climate and social programs.

&gt; Manchin hails from West Virginia, a heavily Republican, sparsely populated coal- and natural gas-producing state that sits at or near the bottom of U.S. health, education and infrastructure rankings.

&gt; The founder and partial owner of a private coal brokerage, Enersystems, Manchin has been reluctant to rein in fossil fuels, complicating Democratic efforts to combat climate change.

&gt; Manchin has signaled he opposes the measure, forcing Democrats to consider paring it down to four weeks or scrapping it altogether.

&gt; Asked on Tuesday whether he had concerns about the paid leave proposal, Manchin said: &amp;quot;I&amp;#039;m concerned about an awful lot of things.""

&gt; Manchin said on Tuesday that he thinks the proposal will not go through.

Pivotal Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin appears to be on board with White House proposals for new taxes on billionaires and certain corporations to help pay for President Joe Bidens scaled-back social services and climate change package

Biden huddled with the conservative West Virginia Democrat and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer at the presidents Delaware home on Sunday as they work on resolving the disputes between centrists and progressives that have stalled the Democrats wide-ranging bill. A person who insisted on anonymity to discuss Manchins position told The Associated Press the senator is agreeable to the White Houses new approach on the tax proposals.

What had been a sweeping $3.5 trillion plan is now being eyed as $1.75 trillion package. Thats within a range that could still climb considerably higher, according to a second person who insisted on anonymity to discuss the private talks.

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said that even at half the original $3.5 trillion proposed, Bidens signature domestic initiative would be larger than any other legislative package with big investments in health care, child care and strategies to tackle climate change.

It is less than what was projected to begin with, but its still bigger than anything we have ever done in terms of addressing the needs of Americas working families,  Pelosi said Sunday on CNNs State of the Union.

Democrats are working intensely to try again to wrap up talks on the measure so the president can spotlight his administrations achievements to world leaders at two overseas summits on the economy and climate change that get underway this week.

Biden met with Manchin and Schumer, D-N.Y. at the presidents home in Wilmington after Democrats missed last weeks deadline to resolve disputes. Biden has said hed like to see a $2 trillion package and they are trying again this upcoming week to rea(...)

Joe Manchin [reportedly told ](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/15/climate/biden-clean-energy-manchin.html)the White House that he strongly opposes the $150 billion clean electricity program that is the muscle behind the presidents efforts to reduce carbon emissions and address climate change. As the New York Times noted, this is a program to rapidly replace the nations coal- and gas-fired power plants with wind, solar and nuclear energy by rewarding utility companies that switch to renewable sources and penalizing those that dont. Now, its expected to be dropped from the reconciliation bill pending in Congress.

[Sen. Joe Manchin on October 6, 2021. By Kevin Dietsch\/Getty Images. ](https://preview.redd.it/48my3eebu8u71.jpg?width=1024&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dc36db052d73fc6b11c46551a844c35c2cee650c)

Its no surprise that Sen. Manchin is determined to deep-six this program: He receives more campaign donations from the oil, coal and gas industries than any other senator. But his veto power over the Biden-led effort to address climate change not only harms the presidents agenda, it accelerates the increasingly visible dangers of fossil fuel-derived carbon emissions. (Its hard to miss the last year of increasingly deadly wildfires, floods and hurricanes, for example, intensified by climate change.)

So heres my question: **How crucial is confronting climate change to you now?** Even as Bidens team attempts to find alternative policies, how big a blow is Manchins opposition? How tragic is this loss to you over a policy that experts say would be the toughest climate policy ever enacted by the US? And how does climate change stack up alongside the many other issues facing America, including the threats to our democracy, gun violence, radical domestic extremism and the continuing reality of unequal justice?

The leadership of the whole world seems to be focused on a meeting in Glasgow, starting on October 31, 10 days away. 

25,000 delegates are expected to attend. They wont be going by boat or bicycle. They will travel first class in planes, belching carbon dioxide, to a conference about limiting carbon dioxide.

The police bill alone is estimated at $500 million. 

That is half a billion dollars.  

It could be said, accurately, that the conference is a failure before it begins. 

India have stated explicitly, this year, that coal will play a significant role in its ambition to become a $5 trillion economy. 

Thats according to Indias Home Minister, a powerful figure in Indias decision making process. In fact, India has acted to increase coal production, improve coal technology and modernise its coal plants. 

And more than 70% of all electricity consumed by Indias 1.3 billion people comes from coal.

India, at this point, have not committed to be there. 

What the hell are we doing heading off to Glasgow? 

And even then, despite an increase in coal production in India in order to supply power plants, as recently as August 28, there was a massive power supply shortage. 

As recently as late last month, the majority of Indias 135 coal plants had one weeks supply of coal. They are after high quality coal. Thats us, thermal coal.

But India also have a massive steel industry and they want high grade coal. 

Thats us, metallurgical coal. 

Which means one thing, Indias purchases of our coal and Russian coal will increase. 

As for coal fired power plants, China has approved, in the first half of this year alone, the construction of 43 new coal fired power plants.

Time Magazine said, China is leading the world in new coal power plants, building more than three times as much new coal power capacity as all other countries in the world combined in 2020.

The Guardian reported, Five Asian countries account for 80% of new coal power investment& China, India, Indonesia, Japan and Vietnam, said the Guardian, and China planned to build more than 600 coal powered units.

Yet were trotting off to Glasgow where the green chickens have already come home to roost. 

Several UK retail electricity providers have collapsed in recent weeks because of the surging price of gas. 

Only this week, Goto Energy joined the list of British firms to close down following the rise in gas prices.

Germanys electricity prices, the poster boy of renewables, oh yes, they work.

Energy experts say some German power suppliers are in danger of going insolvent; and because of Germanys heavy reliance on renewables, Germanys electricity prices have more than doubled since February. 

Skyrocketing power prices have caused UK steel makers to suspend production. 

A former energy advisor to the UK Government has warned that the countrys energy shortage this winter could prompt a three-day working week, which happened way back in 1974.

Anyone trotting off to Glasgow is a fool to rub shoulders with fools. 

Well, Boris Johnson is one of the hosts in Glasgow. So far, he has no plan to take with him to Glasgow. 

He presented to the British Parliament, earlier this week, several documents about net-zero strategies and net-zero reviews meant to offer some idea about how his whole agenda will work. 

To give you an idea about the mess Boris Johnson is in, one of the key steps for the UK to achieve its net-zero targets is changing how people heat their homes, moving them from gas boilers to the more environmentally friendly, heat pumps. 

Ease out gas boilers by 2035. 

But so unattractive is the project, homeowners will be offered 5000 pound subsidies to install the pumps when they replace their boilers. 5000 pounds! 

Now if that sounds crook, the price of a boiler can range from 6000 pounds to 15,000 pounds; critics say the current pot of money will only fund contributions to 90,000 new heat pumps in a country of 67 million. 

I am telling you, these people havent got a clue; they are just hoping.  

But here is the rub. 

No one has put a price on how much net-zero will cost. 

Are you ready for it? 

The British Governments Treasury has not put an overall price on the target but warns that tax rises could be required to balance out the erosion of tax revenue from fossil fuel related activity.

So there you are. 

Whether this all is approved in time for Boris Johnson to go to Glasgow, one thing he wont be able to take to Glasgow is what all this stuff will cost. 

How does the British worker relate to the news that tax rises might be required to balance out the erosion of tax revenue from fossil fuel related activity.

I will come to Australian workers in a moment. 

But, to America. Biden is going to take an entourage of hotshots, presumably for them to do the talk since he cant.

Former President Obama is going.

The only problem is, Biden too might finish up empty handed.

He wants his so-called climate legislation signed into law, but indications today are that he wont get it through the Senate.

Watch one name, Joe Manchin, a conservative Democrat from West Virginia, representing one of the countrys top coal producing regions, the equivalent of North Queensland and the Hunter Valley.

Senator Manchin knows West Virginians wont cop this attack on fossil fuels. 

But Biden needs all 50 Democrat Senators, including Manchin, to pass all legislation through Congress.

Manchin has reportedly said he will block the climate centerpiece in Bidens eye-watering US $3.5 trillion dollar piece of legislation.
 
Michael Mann, one of Americas most prominent climatologists has said on Twitter than Manchin had Just launched a hand grenade at Glasgow.

As I have said, this whole Glasgow charade could be over before it begins. 

Which brings me to Scott Morrison. 

Kevin Rudd went to Cop15 in Copenhagen in 2009. This stuff has been going on forever, we are at COP26. 

Rudd was COP15. 

Remember, Rudd was describing climate change as the greatest moral challenge facing humankind. He came home empty handed. 

Copenhagen, in 2009 was a failure. 

Tony Abbott then made mincemeat of Kevin Rudd. 

President Obama was the American President at the time and right to the death they were desperate to salvage something.

When it was all over, the UN, why would we go cap in hand to the UN on anything, the UN was picking up the pieces from a hopelessly divided, expensive and time wasting conference.

Kevin Rudd had to abandon his climate change legislation.

His credibility as a politician of conviction was almost entirely destroyed and Julia Gillard became Prime Minister six months later. 

Scott Morrison needs to be warned. 

If he goes to Glasgow with an un-costed program which threatens the fossil fuel industry, the source of our economic strength simply to rub shoulders with a stack of left-wing, green zealots, then the people who voted for Scott Morrison in 2019 when he opposed the very stuff this lot are going to Glasgow to endorse  then the Australian voter, the Australian worker, (remember, a lot of traditional Labor voters put Scott Morrison in the Lodge) these voters will say, Mr Morrison, we didnt vote for the Greens, we voted for what you argued about in 2019 - that a 45% reduction in carbon dioxide emissions, not 100%, Labors 45% was reckless, making a carbon tax, look like a mosquito bite.

And your Energy Minister, Angus Taylor, called it a wrecking ball 

Two years ago.

Prime Minister, I repeat, at the last election traditional Labor voters, blue collar workers, voted for you. 

Rubbing shoulders with this lot in Glasgow will lead them to say, simply, youve betrayed us. We need another leader. 

In the pubs they are already saying that they dont imagine a leader like Peter Dutton would countenance, let alone join the economic nonsense being proposed in Glasgow. 

One of the proposals unveiled by Boris Johnson yesterday was that the sale of gas and diesel cars would end by 2030 and car journeys in the cities would have to halve. 

Youd walk or cycle. 

Big Brother is alive and well. 

Scott Morrison, if you come home from Glasgow, and you shouldnt even be going, empty handed with any likely damage or cost to Australias economic wellbeing, then rest assured, the workers of Australia, your quiet Australians will find their voice. 

I have explained, earlier on in this piece, the attitude of China and India to fossil fuels. 

Prime Minister, you want to ignore that? 

The quiet Australian says, that doesnt make sense.

Kevin Rudd failed at Copenhagen. 

His fate may well await you. 

Rudd was replaced as leader. 

You may have to argue why you shouldnt be.","climatedisalarm",2,2,0,0.62,0,0,0,1

**Best Of The Boost**
------------------------------------------------------------------------
**Booster shots of all three approved vaccines are now available for millions of Americans, highly effective shots for young children are just around the corner, and Republicans are still working overtime to spread coronavirus across the land.** Two out of three aint bad?                          
                 
- The CDC has [greenlit booster shots](https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/cdc-panel-recommends-moderna-jj-boosters-rcna3436) of the Moderna and Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccines, after FDA regulators authorized them on Wednesday. CDC Director Rochelle Walensky also signed off on mixing and matching, meaning the 70 million Americans now eligible for booster shots can sample whichever shot they want, regardless of which vaccine they received first. Let the immunity cross-fading commence!                          
                 
- For the moment, booster eligibility is limited to people over 65 and those over 18 who have [certain underlying conditions](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/need-extra-precautions/people-with-medical-conditions.html), live in long-term care settings, or work in [high-risk jobs](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/booster-shot.html#HighRisk). Anyone who received the J&amp;J shot is also now eligible for the chaser of their choosing, as long as its been at least two monthsand evidence suggests that theyd be [better off with Pfizer or Moderna](https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/mix-match-covid-vaccine-boosters-are-effective-nih-study-finds-rcna2974). More than 11 million adults have already received boosters, and there are now [more people getting booster shots](https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2021/10/22/covid-delta-variant-live-updates/) each day than initial shots, according to CDC data.                          
                 
- Those initial-shot numbers should soon get some help from the sub-bar-mitzvah-age crowd. Pfizer said on Friday that its vaccine is safe and [90.7 percent effective](https://www.cnn.com/2021/10/22/health/pfizer-kids-vaccine-efficacy/index.html) against symptomatic infections in children ages five to 11, and the FDAs vaccine advisory committee is scheduled to meet on Tuesday to discuss whether to recommend the vaccine for small-kid authorization. The Biden administration [has smaller doses and a distribution plan ready to go](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/10/20/covid-vaccine-white-house-announces-plan-to-distribute-shot-to-kids-as-soon-as-its-authorized.html), with a focus on pediatricians and pharmacies over mass vaccination sites.                          
                 
**As the national Delta surge continues to abate,** GOP leaders have ramped up their fight against the vaccine mandates that made that progress possible.                          
                 
- Gov. Ron DeSantis (R-FL), reliably on the front lines of pro-COVID dipshittery, has [called for a special session](https://www.politico.com/news/2021/10/21/desantis-florida-special-session-516455) of the Florida legislature to block President Bidens vaccine mandates for business with more than 100 employees. Meanwhile, Floridas new surgeon general Joseph Ladapo has been dutifully [demonstrating why DeSantis hired him](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/politics-news/echoing-desantis-florida-s-new-surgeon-general-argues-against-covid-n1282082), denouncing workplace vax mandates and citing conspiracy theories to question the safety of the vaccines.                          
                 
- Conservatives on the Supreme Court could have the final say on the future of government vaccine mandates when they rule on [*Does v. Mills*](https://www.vox.com/22737016/supreme-court-covid-vaccine-religious-liberty-brett-kavanaugh-amy-coney-barrett-does-mills), the first major case to reach the Court on whether individuals can claim religious liberty to avoid a government vaccine mandate with no such exemption. It could go either way: Even the most far-right justices [havent been receptive to anti-vax whining](https://www.politico.com/news/2021/08/12/amy-coney-barrett-indiana-university-vaccines-504322) thus far. They have, however, been [extremely sympathetic](https://www.npr.org/2021/04/10/986010977/supreme-court-rules-for-worshippers-and-against-california-covid-restrictions) to plaintiffs seeking religious exemptions to other pandemic restrictions. If they decide to open up that loophole for government mandates, theres nothing to stop the unvaccinated from faking beliefs to wriggle through itas Los Angeles cops have [done in droves](https://deadline.com/2021/09/los-angeles-police-religious-exemptions-sought-2600-employees-1234847706/).                          
                 
**Between the booster shot rollout and employer vaccine mandates going into effect, right-wing public-health saboteurs should be limited in the level of damage they can inflict this winter.** That shouldnt absolve them of trying, and every step towards normality should come with the reminder that it was achieved over strenuous GOP objections.

**Preoccupy Wall Street**
------------------------------------------------------------------------
If you have investments, odds are high that your money has been winding up in places you would never put it on purpose. Places like Mitch McConnells campaign coffers. Heres the problem: A lot of Americans own S&amp;P 500 index fundsthese are funds made up of the 500 largest U.S. publicly traded companies available, and they collectively contain [over $1.5 trillion dollars](https://www.etf.com/channels/sp-500-etfs) of Americans retirement money.                          
                 
Unfortunately, when you buy an S&amp;P 500 index fund, youre buying stock in the following companies:                          
                 
- **AT&amp;T**, which is already back supporting the election objectors in Congress, as well as the GOP sponsors of Texass abortion ban and voter-suppression law. Its also a top donor to Mitch McConnell and Lindsey Graham.                          
                 
- **ExxonMobil**, which has misled the public about the dangers of climate change and spent huge amounts on Facebook ads to get Donald Trump reelected in 2020.                          
                 
- **Halliburton**, one of the nations biggest defense contractors, which has funneled millions to the GOP.                          
                 
- **Lockheed Martin**, which is one the largest weapons manufacturers in the world and one of Lindsey Grahams top contributors.                          
                 
The list goes on. But before you stuff all of your savings in your mattress and call it a day, you should know about DEMZ.                          
                 
[DEMZ](https://demz.fund/) is the first investment product that allows you to get similar performance and exposure you would expect from the S&amp;P 500,  without all the Mitch McConnell. It only includes companies who have made over 75% of their political contributions to Democratic causes and candidates. Since launching in November of 2020, DEMZ has outperformed the S&amp;P 500 by 7 percent.

Domestic divisions are the greatest threat to our national security.
-Susan Rice.

Identity with a political tribe has taken supreme precedence over matters such as ideology. Blind allegiance is rewarded, not independence, thoughtful consideration, or compromise. Dissent has lost much of its political prestige, the respect, if begrudging, for those profiles in courage has largely evaporated. Courageous senators of a time not long past were once applauded for their courage, if not their action (Wayne Morse on the Gulf of Tonkin, James Buckley on Watergate, Charles Goodell on Vietnam, or Howard Baker on the Panama Canal)a When we do see courageous political dissent (e.g from John McCain on the Affordable Care Act or Joe Manchin on the nomination of Justice Kavanaugh), its emissaries are greeted with only contempt. The descent of politics into a conflict between groups held in near religious reverence by their followers is antithetical to democracy itself and seems to absolve its participants from the basic rigors of civility. Civil disagreement is trumped by a hatred reminiscent of that between Protestants and Catholics in Northern Ireland. From Jesse Helms, Newt Gingrich, or the Tea Party on the right to Bernie Sanders, Alexandria Ocasio Cortez, and the Justice Democrats of the left, polarization has grown steadily worse.
These partisan tribes develop norms that are then used as the standards for partisan to be conforming group members. As people identify with a group more strongly, they conform to these tribal norms to appear as good members of their tribe, and those who do not conform to the tribal norms are targeted by the extremists within the tribe through systems such as primaries. For instance, Republican Representative Bob Inglis of South Carolina lost a 2010 primary to Trey Gowdy by 40 points despite having a 93% rating from the American Conservative Union due to Ingliss support of climate legislation, a post recession bailout, and his opposition to the 2007 troop surge in Iraq. Even dissent as minor as Representative Ingliss can trigger a tribal reaction from the group. Georgia Senator Kelly Loeffler campaigns extensively on her voting record of siding with President Trump on 100% of votes, in my view it is a sad reflection on the state of our political process if an absolute lack of dissent is applauded by ones supporters. 
In 2016 researchers assembled 1,178 Washingtonians for a study on how partisanship affected their perception of a ballot measure that would institute a carbon tax. The group was divided evenly between Republicans and Democrats; those groups were further divided into a groups viewing Republican endorsements of the policy and Democratic opposition, and a group viewing Republican opposers to the policy and Democratic endorsers. While Republicans continually opposed the policy, they were much more prone to supporting it when told that famous Republicans such as George Shultz (An advisor to the Eisenhower Administration, Nixons Secretary of Labor and the Treasury, and finally Reagans Secretary of State) had endorsed the policy. This gap was only more pronounced among the well educated in these groups. Global warming is an existential threat to humanity itself, yet our views on it are largely informed due to partisan biases as opposed to scientific fact. 
The Medias Role:
The Soviet Unions propaganda newspaper was entitled Pravda, Russian for truth, so too does Fox News motto of Fair and Balanced disguise propaganda and an impartiality taken seriously by few. Politics is not a sport, to create policy and build a united nation compromise is second only to the understanding of others beliefs. Media-be it from the right or left-portrays political happenings as a conflict between two teams, with a win being valued over the nations wellbeing, and, as the saying goes, perception often becomes reality. The facile portrayal of politics as a sport in news has led political discourse to increasingly adopt these characteristics. Media gains views through sensationalism and the portrayal of politics as a horse race, but in doing so it preys on our divisions and often provides a platform to those such as climate change deniers or other conspiracy theorists who normally would be shut from the arena of mainstream political belief. As Carlton University professor Jim Davies explains, everything about the newsfrom the dramatic headlines to the riveting background music to the colors on the screen (lots of red, which experts agree is one of, if not the most, emotionally charged color)is engineered to prey on our hardwired impulses to pay attention to what seems exciting and important. The manner in which the news is presentedbe it on television or the social feeds on our phoneoften triggers the release of dopamine, a powerful neurochemical that tags experiences as meaningful and makes us want to seek them over and over again. 
The national motto of the United States is E Pluribus Unum or Out of Many, One. Humans are naturally tribal creatures, but our founders understood that democracy requires us to embrace pluralism and unite our many tribes into one united nation. Social media is in diametric opposition to these principles, sorting us into tribal echo chambers by way of clandestine algorithms that dehumanize our opposition and do no more than confirm our biases. Social media has also opened the door to foreign interference in our elections and the inflammation of our tribal instincts by way of Russian, Chinese, or Iranian propaganda. Foreign disinformation now colors our view of our fellow Americans and of our democratic processes themselves. Anti-democratic actors such as Father Coughlinb harnessed the new technology of radio to fan the flames of fascism, but today we are faced with thousands of Fathers Coughlin spreading disinformation not in weekly radio broadcasts, but in a never-ending firehose of social media extremism that pushes our society deeper into division. Tom Wheeler of the Brookings Institution put it well; digital technology is gnawing at the core of democracy by dividing us into tribes and devaluing truth. 
The Importance of Interaction:
I would argue that the best way to stymie hateful tribalism in the media is not to legislation, but often very minor actions taken by us. I would argue two primary actions should be taken; firstly, one should view media from across the political spectrum; secondly, one should engage in discussion with those you disagree with. As Zachary Wood explained in a Ted Talk, tuning out opposing viewpoints doesn't make them go away, because millions of people agree with them. In order to understand the potential of society to progress forward, we need to understand the counterforces. People increasingly do not interact with ideas they oppose, and in doing so they lose an understanding of those ideas and come to regard their opponents as what is known as strawmen, as Krysta Scripter explains Especially when we hold a strong opinion, it's increasingly less likely that we're talking [..] with anyone who disagrees. Interaction with those we disagree with also fosters intellectual humility, defined by the Journal of Positive Psychology as the ability to have an accurate view of ones intellectual strengths and limitations and the ability to negotiate ideas in a fair and inoffensive manner.  It has been shown that this intellectual humility can not only improve ones learning abilities, but their social skills as well. 
The engagement with others ideas also reinforces the ideal of pluralism, which is often considering an underpinning of democracy. Pluralism, defined by Oxford as a condition or system in which two or more states, groups, principles, sources of authority, etc., coexist., allows for a democracy in which diverse ideas are expected to compete, if we cannot coexist with others, we cannot properly function as a democracy. For instance, Marwan Muasher, a Middle Eastern policy expert at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, argues that a lack of pluralism has been a defining factor in the destabilization of many areas in the Middle East. By interacting with others, we are learning for ourselves while helping support the foundations of democracy.
 System of the Fringes:
The factors contributing to partisanship can be traced to the very roots of our electoral systems themselves. Closed partisan primaries, gerrymandering, and our first past the post voting system collaborate to enable a vocal minority of extremists to hold final sway over our electoral process. Only a small percentage of eligible voters even bother to vote in primaries, and these are commonly the most extreme of the electorate. As former U.S Representative Mickey Edwards(R-OK) notes, only 8% of the total Alabama electorate voted for far-right Judge Roy Moore over incumbent Senator Luther Stranged in the 2017 Republican special election primary, and Strange was by all means more popular among the general electorate than Moore, yet it was Moore who advanced to the general election. In Nebraskas Second Congressional District progressive Democrat Kara Eastman lost to Republican Don Bacon by 4.8% even as Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden carried the district by nearly 6 points; Eastmans moderate Democratic primary opponent Ann Ashford would have been very likely to win the seat. Candidates such as Moore or Eastman are able to win primaries, and thus advance to be one of two, or even the only, competitive candidate in a general election by appealing to small yet vocal aspects of the electorate. The bottom line is clear: primaries do not represent the electorate. 
The second issue I would cite is gerrymandering, which is closely connected to the first. Gerrymandering, named for Vice President Elbridge Gerrye, is a practice in which legislatures draw legislative districts in such a way as to maximize the benefits of one political party; Gerrymandering has been a persistent issue throughout American history, but it has become more significant than ever as of late. Competitive elections are a cornerstone of democracy yet Gerrymandering reduces the value of elections while removing competition, allowing politicians to become increasingly radical without facing serious electoral hurdles. A study by Antoine Yoshinaka and Chad Murphy found that members of the out-of-power party tended to have more drastic changes made to their districts as a way for the in-power party to insulate its members. For instance, as the Brenna Center for Justices notes that gerrymandering in Maryland removed Republican Roscoe Bartlett in 2012. Marylands gerrymandering also means that (relatively) far left Representatives such as Kweisi Mfume and (relatively) far right Representative Andy Harris are both consistently re-elected by large margins; ideally both districts would overlap with more significant support for the other party and ensure competitive elections. Furthermore, if congressional districts were drawn to ensure and encourage competition, the congressional balance would be taken out of the hands of a small number of voters in swing districts. Some would argue that this would allow parties to seize supermajorities, I would disagree as in a congressional map drawn to be as competitive as possible it is unlikely that any party would be able to win all of the competitive seats, and if this were to happen the party would have to have moved to the center enough that it would represent the majority will. 
Thirdly, our first past the post voting system is flawed. The system allows for phenomena such as vote splitting and allows candidates to win with small shares of the vote, as low as under 30% in some primaries or 35% in general elections. This system allows candidates to succeed with wedges of the public and disempowers third parties. For instance, in 1974 former U.S Representative Ray Blanton won the Democratic primary with 22.7% of the vote, Blanton would defeat Republican Lamar Alexander in the general election but his single term as Governor would be marred by scandal and RealClearPolitics would name him one of the Ten Most Corrupt Politicians in American history, in the final days of his governorship, he would infamously pardon two dozen convicted murderers and 28 others in exchange for money.
Great political leaders of the past-LBJ, Sam Rayburn, Howard Baker, Bob Dolef-understood the importance of compromise, and only through that understanding were they able to achieve the legislative reforms they did, yet legislative leaders today stifle the legislative process and focus instead on their own interests, putting party above democracy. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell(R-KY) has long been known as a master of legislative obstruction not seen since the days of James Alleng, while Representative Justin Amash has said of Speaker Nancy Pelosis tactics We have not been allowed to offer amendments on the House floor in more than four years. In effect, every bill we vote on is take it or leave it.. That being said, there are still those who value compromise, such as Senator Diane Feinstein(D-CA) or retiring Senator Lamar Alexander(R-TN), but our legislative leaders, enabled by primaries and our voting system, largely stymie attempts at compromise.
A Framework for Unity:
The majority of Americans are exhausted with partisan tribalism. Most Americans are not far right or far left, yet both sides maintain caricatures of one another, and an increasing number of Americans confine themselves to partisan-not necessarily ideological-echo chambers that fail to provide them with the support for pluralism and understanding of opposing views that is critical to democracy. I argue that three crucial electoral reforms should be instituted, a commission to end gerrymandering, a blanket primary, and ranked choice voting. 
States have consistently altered their primary systems since Robert La Follette popularized the idea in the early 1900s, one, Indiana, went farther. Indiana was a hotbed of the  Klux Klan during the organizations second wave and officials as influential as the states Governor were members of the terrorist group. Members of the Klan were significantly more likely to vote in primaries than any other group and could seize control of the political system due to their high turnout rates in these primaries, this led Indiana to largely do away with the primary system for local elections in 1928; they would not be restored until the mid 1970s. That being noted, I would not advocate for the abolition of primaries, instead I would argue for abolishing the partisan requirements tied to primaries. States such as Vermont allow one to choose whether to vote in the Republican or Democratic primaries in the state regardless of party affiliation, allowing independents and others into the fold and enabling the primary to be more representative.
That being said, some have gone farther and instituted the now largely forgotten blanket primary, which I would argue would be the best alternative. A blanket primary system allows voters to vote in any partys primary for different offices, with the candidate with the best showing from each party advancing to the general election, : this system commonly produced consensus candidates. Washington and Alaska long maintained a blanket primary system, which contributed to both states being quite competitive, as liberal Republicans such as Daniel Evans won in the generally Democratic state of Washington. A blanket primary was adopted by California in the 1996, but the Supreme Court overruled decades of precedent in the 2001 decision California Democratic Party v. Jones and deemed the blanket primary unconstitutional. The reasoning in this decision, put forth by Justice Scalia in a 7-2 decisionh, was that parties can govern their own affairs; I would disagree and argue that this falls out of the scope of a party affair and would posit that it is an affair of the people and furthermore argue the decision was a violation of states rights. As Justice Stevens puts it in his dissent A State's power to determine how its officials are to be elected is a quintessential attribute of sovereignty.
Secondly how can gerrymandering be stymied, and how should we redraw the maps? I would suggest one of two solutions, either an algorithm or a nonpartisan committee to redistrict. I would argue congressional maps are best drawn in a manner that would ensure the highest number of competitive districts. FiveThirtyEight, a polling and analysis website ran by Nate Silver, recently released a series of 8 congressional maps gerrymandered in various ways, one of these is drawn to maximize competition. The maximized competition map includes 242 highly competitive districts, this ensures that ones vote is likely to have a significant impact while ensuring that elections are not confined to several dozen congressional districts, practically disenfranchising large portions of the electorate. As David Daley of the electoral reform organization FairVote notes If your goal is to reduce polarization, this system would reduce the oversized influence of partisan voters in low-turnout primaries, give moderate and independent voters more choices, and empower the broader electorate that turns out in November general elections
Finally, how we can reform our voting system itself. Several ideas have gained popularity, including approval voting (utilized in Bismarck, North Dakota), but by and large the most popular is ranked choice voting, Maine uses ranked choice voting in its elections, and Alaska recently approved a referendum to do so as well. Ranked choice voting would allow people to rank every candidate for an office in order of preference, candidates are eliminated in each round and their votes redistributed to their second choice until a candidate possesses a majority vote. The majority requirement ensures that candidates possess a true mandate for their policies: other effects of ranked choice voting include more moderate candidates as candidates are required to appeal to a larger segment of the electorate, less tribalism and a more civil political culture as candidates are competing for the second or third choice votes of those who may support another candidate as their first-choice vote, and the negation of the spoiler effect. 
Opponents of ranked-choice voting make several arguments, well summarized in the Heritage Foundation piece Ranked Choice Voting Is A Bad Choice but the primary argument is the claim that in a ranked-choice system, one could vote for a candidate they greatly dislike, whom they ranked quite low. I would object vehemently to this argument. Firstly, one would never vote for the candidate they ranked last, and if one were not comfortable voting for multiple candidates they could leave them out of their rankings. Secondly, one will only vote for a candidate ranked low on their ballot if the election is down to that candidate and the candidate or candidates one has ranked lower. For example, if one were to have ranked every third-party presidential candidate above Joe Biden and Donald Trump in this election but still ranked Biden above Trump, their vote would have gone to their second least favored candidate, but only because the alternative was a candidate they favored even less.
Our political system is in chaos, and technologies such as social media exacerbate these issues. Electoral reform and reforms to our manner of politics are, frankly, the only way we can escape this political quagmire for brighter pastures.
 
Footnotes:
a.. The four acts of political courage I reference here are as follows; Wayne Morse(D-OR) being one of two Senators to oppose the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution; James Buckley(R/C-NY) being the first conservative Senator to call for the resignation of President Nixon; Appointed Senator Charles Goodell(R-NY) opposing the Vietnam War, an action which led to his defeat in the 1970 election, losing the support even of the Nixon White House; and Republican Senate Leader Howard Baker(R-TN) aiding President Carter with negotiations surrounding the Panama Canal, which may have cost him the 1980 Republican presidential nomination.
b. Father Charles Coughlin was a radio priest from the late 1930s and early 1940s infamous for his advocacy for, arguably, fascist policies and for sympathizing with the enemy during WWII, his weekly broadcasts attracted millions of listeners until he was removed from air early in WWII, although he continued to preside over his church until his death in the late 1970s.
c. The strawman fallacy is defined by Wikipedia as a form of argument and an informal fallacy of having the impression of refuting an argument, whereas the proper idea of argument under discussion was not addressed or properly refuted.
d. I would note that Senator Strange was an appointed incumbent, but an incumbent nonetheless, and one who had demonstrated relative popularity with the general electorate in the past before.
e. Gerry was Governor of Massachusetts at the time of the redistricting, and in fairness to him, he was reluctant to support the redistricting bill. The term gerrymander comes from a political cartoon soon after the bill was passed.
f. LBJ refers to Lyndon Baines Johnson, I refer more so to his work as Senate Majority Leader from 1953-1960 than to his work in the Presidency. Sam Rayburn, the longest serving Speaker of the House in American history, was LBJs counterpart from 1953-1960 and served as Speaker until his death in 1961, both Texans, Rayburn was a significant influence on LBJ and in some ways served as a father figure. Howard Baker served as Republican Senate Leader from 1977-`985, the last four of those years at Majority Leader. Bob Dole served as Bakers successor, both were influential legislators who valued bipartisanship.
g. James Jim Allen served as a Senator from Alabama from 1969-1977 and was an infamous master of senate rules. Allens behavior almost single handedly led to the lowering of the filibuster threshold from 67 votes to 60, I would recommend Walter Mondaless account of the matter, which may be found in his memoir, The Good Fight.
h. Justices Ginsburg and Stevens dissented.

Shares of Snap (SNAP) tumbled around 20% AH on Thursday following results that some are referring to as ""ad-mageddon."" The long-feared internet advertising meltdown was responsible for a revenue miss in Q3, with sales coming in at $1.07B vs. expectations for $1.1B. The company also detailed a worse forecast for the coming holiday quarter, which is typically one of the busiest, saying it anticipated a revenue growth rate of 19%-20%, down from third quarter growth of 57%.

What happened? ""Our advertising business was disrupted by changes to iOS ad tracking that were broadly rolled out by Apple (AAPL) in June and July,"" CEO Evan Spiegel said on a conference call. ""While we anticipated some degree of business disruption, the new Apple-provided measurement solution did not scale as we had expected, making it more difficult for our advertising partners to measure and manage their ad campaigns for iOS.""

Over the past few quarters, direct-response advertising has grown to more than 50% of Snap's business, but given the recent changes, ""coupled with Snapchat's existence as a mobile-only platform, our strength in DR has become a more significant headwind in the current environment."" Ad-dependent peers were also hit by the headlines, trading lower in premarket trade: Twitter (TWTR) -4.5%; Facebook (FB) -4.1%; Pinterest (PINS) -2.4%; Google (GOOGL) -1.9%.

Go deeper: Apple's privacy change is not the only contributor of the advertising slowdown. Ad partners facing supply chain issues and labor shortages ""reduced short-term appetite"" to generate demand for their products, according to Spiegel, and the trends could get worse if the bottlenecks don't clear up. It's also an interesting instance of tech stocks getting hammered due to sale struggles in the physical world, where companies do not spend on online marketing for goods they cannot get to users (not to mention another setback to the economic recovery).

Updated agenda

At a CNN town hall in Baltimore last night, President Biden provided some insights into recent negotiations with Democrats over his economic agenda. The measure has stalled in the Senate due to objections from West Virginia's Joe Manchin and Arizona's Kyrsten Sinema, who have cited heavy spending concerns over expanding the social safety net and combating climate change. Biden is specifically looking to get a framework agreement in place, so the House could vote on a bipartisan infrastructure bill before he arrives at the UN Climate Conference in Glasgow in less than two weeks.

Highlights: Biden won't support a work requirement for the child tax credit, the paid parental leave provision has been narrowed down from 12 weeks to 4 weeks, a proposal to make community college free would be eliminated, and money scrapped clean energy programs would likely be reallocated to other climate efforts.

Most importantly, Biden said it's unlikely that corporate tax rate hikes will be included in the plan. ""I don't think we're going to be able to get the vote,"" he declared. ""Look, when you're in the United States Senate and you're president of the United States and you have 50 Democrats, everyone is the president.""

Supply chain: A question was also asked if Biden would deploy the National Guard to alleviate pressure on the nation's truckers. He responded that ""the answer is yes,"" though a White House official said shortly afterwards that the administration is not actively considering a deployment to ease the supply chain gridlock. ""Requesting the use of the National Guard at the state level is under the purview of governors and we are not actively pursuing the use of the National Guard on a federal level.""

Last-minute payment

While it was on the brink of default heading into the weekend, China Evergrande Group (OTCPK:EGRNF) seems to have pulled off an $83.5M bond coupon payment before Saturday. A 30-day grace period would have expired tomorrow after the original missed payment date, but the drama is still far from over. Evergrande still needs to pay $573M on another four dollar notes this year and faces $7.7B in bond maturities in 2022.

Snapshot: A default could have led to the biggest corporate default in Asia, allowing creditors to declare defaults on some of Evergrande's other debts. The company is one of China's biggest property developers, and its most indebted, with the equivalent of more than $300B in total liabilities. Evergrande's Hong Kong-listed stock has slumped more than 80% YTD, though shares rose as much as 5% today on the latest developments.

Some say it is kicking the can down the road, but others feel the interest payment is some good news, giving Evergrande time for asset sales and strengthening its case of an orderly restructuring. It's already been trying to raise funds by disposing stakes in subsidiaries and a Hong Kong office building, while last month it agreed to sell most of its ownership in a Chinese commercial bank for $1.6B. It had also planned to offload a majority holding in its property management division for $2.6B, but those talks fell through this week.

Fears of contagion: Both Chinese Vice Premier Liu He and PBOC Governor Yi Gang feel that Evergrande's risks are controllable and reasonable capital demands from property companies are being met. However, worries have roiled markets due to concerns about a potential spillover into the rest of China's economy. The situation has already led to a string of default announcements and rating downgrades, as well as a rumbling across the $5T Chinese property sector, which accounts for a quarter of GDP by some metrics.

Fed ethics review

Federal Reserve officials will no longer be able to buy individual securities following the recent controversy over portfolios that resulted in the departure of two regional bank presidents. That means no more stock picking and active trading of derivatives, leaving officials to only purchase diversified investment vehicles, like mutual funds. The new restrictions will apply to both Reserve Bank and Board policymakers, as well as senior staff.

Quote: ""These tough new rules raise the bar high in order to assure the public we serve that all of our senior officials maintain a single-minded focus on the public mission of the Federal Reserve,"" Fed Chair Jay Powell said in a statement.

Earlier this week, The American Prospect reported that Powell also sold up to $5M in a broad index fund as the economy was recovering from the pandemic last year. The $1M-$5M sale from the Vanguard Total Stock Market Index (VTI) in October 2020 would likely hold up under the new rules, as well as the between $50K-$100K sales he made on Sept. 21. In December, Powell also sold small stakes of the Causeway International Value Fund (CIVIX), the Goldman Sachs U.S. Equity Dividend and Premium Fund (GSPKX), iShares MSCI EAFE ETF (EFA) and the iShares Russell 2000 ETF (IWM).

More details: ""To help guard against even the appearance of any conflict of interest in the timing of investment decisions, policymakers and senior staff generally will be required to provide 45 days advance notice for purchases and sales of securities, obtain prior approval for purchases and sales of securities, and hold investments for at least one year. Further, no purchases or sales will be allowed during periods of heightened financial market stress."" (12 comments)

&gt; Manchin has said that wants the bill to include a maximum of $1.5 trillion in new spending, which is $2 trillion less than originally proposed.

&gt; One such prominent donor is Peltz, who has given to Manchin and hosted fundraisers for Trump that cost as much as $580,000 per couple to attend.

&gt; Manchin has taken issue with many of the provisions in the social spending bill, including extending the current child tax credit, insisting on means-testing and work requirements so that only those working and making less than $60,000 a year would qualify.

Brian Schatz (D-HI) [said on Wednesday](https://twitter.com/sahilkapur/status/1450852000569102343?s=20). But there are still some big question marks, primarily around whether and how to stop the oceans from boiling. Now that Sen. Joe Manchin (D-WV) has dumped proposals for a clean-energy program and a carbon tax over the side of the Almost Heaven, its not clear what the bills final climate provisions will look like.                          
                 
- While were waiting, lets check in with the latest news on how Manchins climate obstruction will hurt his own constituents! In addition to dealing with [worsening, inescapable floods](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/17/climate/manchin-west-virginia-flooding.html), West Virginia residents can look forward to continuing to pay [sky-high electricity bills](https://www.cnn.com/2021/10/19/politics/west-virginia-coal-rates-manchin-climate/index.html). While most states now generate less than 40 percent of their electricity from coal, West Virginia relies on it for 89 percent of its power. The states reliance on coal might be [lining Manchins own pockets](https://theintercept.com/2021/09/03/joe-manchin-coal-fossil-fuels-pollution/), but his constituents will face unmanageable bills every winter as the cost of coal-fired power continues to rise.                          
                 
**The scramble to find Manchin-proof climate provisions isnt the only remaining tangle.**                          
                 
- Manchins insistence on means-testing every social program in the bill could have harmful side-effects beyond the obvious cruelties of things like [limiting the child tax credit](https://www.dailykos.com/stories/2021/10/20/2059268/-Manchin-may-or-may-not-be-issuing-bombshell-threats-but-he-s-definitely-complicating-Biden-s-agenda) to families making less than $60,000. (Progressives have called that number a nonstarter.) According to one analysis, the current design of Democrats child care plan [could wind up hurting middle class families](https://www.peoplespolicyproject.org/2021/10/20/democratic-child-care-plan-will-spike-prices-for-the-middle-class-by-13000/): By raising wages for child-care workers (good), it would also raise the cost of unsubsidized child care, but families earning just over their states median income would receive no subsidies for the first three years of the program, so their child-care costs would simply spike (awful).                          
                 
- A spokesperson for the House Committee on Education and Labor [defended the programs design](https://twitter.com/BenjySarlin/status/1450858293824528391?s=20), arguing that worker wages wouldnt rise abruptly enough to gouge middle-class parents before their subsidies kicked in. Best-case scenario, thats right, and means-testing just makes the plan annoyingly complicated. Worst-case scenario, thats wrong, and a whole bunch of voters discover that Democrats have accidentally saddled them with extra costs just in time for some hugely important elections. Seems like something to take a closer look at before it becomes law!                          
                 
**It looks increasingly likely that Democrats will manage to bring Smanchinema on board to pass *something*, and improve a lot of Americans lives in the process.** Whether that final deal will include the kind of game-changing climate initiative the world needsand exclude the kind of political self-own that Democrats cant affordremains to be seen.

(U up, Attorney General Merrick Garland?) The Westchester, NY, district attorneys office has subpoenaed records from Trump National Golf Club Westchester, as well as from the town of Ossining, which sets property taxes for the courseevidently looking into whether the Trump Organization lied about the golf clubs property value to catch a break on taxes. For those keeping track at home, the company is already under indictment for tax fraud in Manhattan, and both Manhattan District Attorney Cy Vance and New York Attorney General Letitia James are still investigating the valuations of other Trump properties.

That does not jibe with world leaders promise to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius, the ceiling for avoiding the most catastrophic climate scenarios. Leaders will be able to discuss that discrepancy when they gather at the U.N. climate summit in Glasgow at the end of the monthand President Biden will be in a much stronger position to pressure other countries to change their ways if Democrats have passed some hefty climate legislation before it rolls around.

(I'm a bot)
*****
&gt; Sen. Joe Manchin on Thursday derided his own party&amp;#039;s plan to spend $3.5 trillion over the next decade to combat the climate crisis, invest in child care, and expand Medicare as &amp;quot;fiscal insanity.

&gt; Manchin has casually voted for nearly three times that for defense spending.

&gt; Last week, the House of Representatives passed the $770 billion military policy bill-which includes $740 billion for the Pentagon alone-by a vote of 316-113, with just 38 Democrats voting no.

&gt; In ongoing talks over the reconciliation package, Manchin is pushing for a top-line spending level of $1.5 trillion.

&gt; That figure is at least $2 trillion less over 10 years than Democrats&amp;#039; current plan, which would spend $3.5 trillion over the next decade.

&gt; As Win Without War executive director Stephen Miles noted Thursday, Manchin&amp;#039;s preferred $1.5 trillion number is &amp;quot;less than we&amp;#039;ll spend at the Pentagon over the next two years.

**Clark And Dagger**
------------------------------------------------------------------------
**The Senate Judiciary Committee released a new report laying out in terrifying detail just how close we came to living in the United States of MAGArica,** as the GOP issued its own informal report titled, Yeah That Would Be Fine By Us, Actually.                          
                 
- The report by the committees Democratic majority [provides a more complete account](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/trump-2020-election-overturn-report_n_615e7e24e4b084c82410786d) of a January 3 meeting about then-President Donald Trumps plan to remove the acting attorney general and replace him with a loyalist (then-DOJ official Jeffrey Clark) who would help him overturn the election results. All that stopped him was a threat from top Justice Department officials and other government lawyers to resign en masse, with White House counsel Pat Cipollone comparing Trumps coup attempt to a murder-suicide pact.                          
                 
- The document also offers further details about Clarkes own efforts to get the DOJ to throw its weight behind Trumps election fraud lies, and the pressure Rep. Scott Perry (R-PA) put on then-Acting Deputy Attorney General Richard Donoghue to help sow doubt about Bidens victory in Pennsylvania. This report shows the American people just how close we came to a constitutional crisis, Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Dick Durbin [said in a statement](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/06/us/politics/trump-election-fraud-report.html). Thanks to a number of upstanding Americans in the Department of Justice, Donald Trump was unable to bend the department to his will. But it was not due to a lack of effort.                          
                 
- Thanks to a few upsetting Americans in the Department of Justice, the committees report was not as complete as it might have been. Senior DOJ attorney Bradley Weinsheimer [repeatedly blocked](https://www.politico.com/news/2021/10/07/doj-shields-ex-trump-officials-515594) former officials from answering Democrats questions about the departments handling of voter-fraud claims. Weinsheimer cited guidance he had issued in July that authorized former DOJ officials to testify before Congress, but limited which topics they could talk about. The Senate Judiciary Committee aides conducting the interviews said that some of the questions Weinsheimer shut down were fully relevant to understanding what Trump was trying to do.                          
                 
**Its not like Trump needs any extra help from the Biden administration when it comes to shielding himself from justice.**                          
                 
- Trump has [directed four top aides to defy subpoenas](https://www.politico.com/news/2021/10/07/trump-jan-6-committees-subpoena-515593) from the House January 6 committee, and indicated that hell go to court to block their testimony. Those aides are former social media director Dan Scavinowhos [already hiding](https://www.cnn.com/2021/10/05/politics/house-committee-january-6-subpoena-serve-dan-scavino/index.html) from the committees process serversformer Pentagon official/Devin Nunes protege Kash Patel, former White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows, and former White House malevolent blob Steve Bannon, all of whom are [expected to be on board](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/oct/06/trump-aides-capitol-attack-house-select-committee) with Operation Obstruction.                          
                 
- Meanwhile, Republicans are doing their part by maintaining residency in the alternate reality where the election was inconclusive and the insurrection never happened. During a Thursday House hearing on the GOP sham audit in Maricopa County, Rep.

""That other courts may find a way to avoid this conclusion is theirs to decide; this Court will not sanction one more day of this offensive deprivation of such an important right."" Its not yet clear how widely that pause will actually improve access to abortion in Texas. In anticipation of just such a ruling, Texas Republicans included a provision in the law that allows Texans to sue abortion clinics for abortions they perform during an enforcement pause, assuming higher courts would eventually lift the injunction. And Texas has already taken predictable steps to appeal the ruling to the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals, one of the most conservative courts in the country.

&gt; Already under fire from progressive activists and lawmakers for holding up congressional Democrats and President Joe Biden&amp;#039;s agenda, Sen.

&gt; &amp;quot;It is cruel and unfathomable that she&amp;#039;s demanding severe cuts to lifesaving climate legislation, but not surprising since she&amp;#039;s been meeting nonstop with corporate executives,&amp;quot; she said.

&gt; Democrats are expected to protect a proposed $150 billion clean electricity program as well as about $300 billion in tax incentives for wind and solar power and electric vehicles, the Times noted.

&gt; They may slash or scale back up to another $200 billion in other climate programs as part of an effort to win over Sinema and Manchin by reducing the package by $1.5 trillion.

&gt; Those could include a number of programs designed to help poor people adapt to the destructive impacts of climate change, as well as $30 billion for a &amp;quot;Green Bank&amp;quot; to help communities finance construction of solar panels and electric vehicle charging stations, and $30 billion to create a &amp;quot;Civilian Climate Corps&amp;quot; that would hire young adults to work in climate mitigation and adaptation, with half coming from communities of color.

&gt; Other potential cuts could include a $13 billion program to build new electric vehicle charging stations-including $1 billion to ensure that those stations are built in lower-income areas.

**Little Deuce Coup**
------------------------------------------------------------------------
**In the almost two weeks since Democrats in Congress recommitted to passing both the Senate infrastructure bill and the Build Back Better Act in tandem, before the end of October,** they have made big strides toward consensus that Build Back Better will be...something something.                          
                 
- In [a letter to colleagues Monday](https://www.speaker.gov/newsroom/101121-0), House Speaker Nancy Pelosi suggested that Democrats would deal with their new Sinemanchinized spending cap by shrinking the number of reforms in Build Back Better, rather than by making all the reforms smaller and less generous. Overwhelmingly, the guidance I am receiving from Members is to do fewer things well so that we can still have a transformative impact on families in the workplace and responsibly address the climate crisis, she wrote.                          
                 
- But then at a Capitol press briefing on Tuesday, she said Democrats hope they will not have to drop key family support programs from their bill, and would instead be cutting back on years. In other words, instead of dropping lower-priority programs to bulletproof a smaller number of reforms, theyll include many programs in Build Back Better and set them to expire in a few years. That would hold down the price tag of the bill itself, and line up political fights throughout the coming decade over whether the programs should expire or be renewed.                          
                 
- The continued indecision reflects divisions within the party over which approach is preferable. Progressives would generally like to create many expansive reforms, and bet on them to be so popular that even Republicans will refuse to let them expire. Sen. Joe Manchin (D-WV) [seems to think that political calculation is correct, but views it as a bad thing](https://www.axios.com/manchin-progressives-prioritize-family-programs-07836848-3d9d-4dd7-b138-f4ebbe499ba9.html), and thus wants the bill to create a smaller number of permanent reforms and drop the rest.                          
                 
**The Manchin approach may sound tidier and less risky, but in the near-term it makes everything more complicated.**                          
                 
- One problem is that some Build Back Better priorities are inextricably linked to one another. Manchin [reportedly hopes](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/meet-the-press/democrats-wrestle-tough-choices-budget-plans-are-scaled-back-n1281315) to scale back or drop Bidens plan to subsidize child-care services and focus instead on creating a universal pre-kindergarten program. The difficulty is that if you fund universal pre-K without also funding daycare for infants and younger toddlers, the daycare facilities will lose staff to beefed up pre-K institutions and thus have to either shrink or close or raise prices.                          
                 
- Another problem is that Build Back Better is only so big because the safety net hasnt been updated in over a decade and demand for improvements has piled up. Forcing Democrats to eliminate some priorities from their agenda will exacerbate tensions within the party coalition and among legislators who have spent years building support for their pet issues, which may soon be on the chopping block. Its harder to build support and enthusiasm for child-care reforms if enacting them required abandoning, say, vision and dental coverage for seniors.                          
                 
**This tension may explain why Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) [keeps hounding Manchin and Sen. Kyrsten Sinema (D-AZ)](https://twitter.com/mkraju/status/1447983096280854537?s=20) to spell out what they want to cut.** Forced to own the consequences of their centrist demands, they might relent on some of them. At her press conference, Pelosi said Im optimistic well get to where we need to be in a timely fashion. Lets hope thats the case because the progress has been halting so far.

**Under The Radar**
------------------------------------------------------------------------
**The Paycheck Protection Program, which helped protect businesses from the ravages of the pandemic, also [empowered smaller banks with racist staff to withhold loans from black borrowers](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/11/business/ppp-loans-covid-racial-bias.html) through 2020.** Though the program was administered by private lenders, the federal government underwrote its loans. That eliminated credit risk as a criterion for rejecting loan applications, which in turn insulated the program from exacerbating a key existing racial disparity among business owners. Nevertheless, minority entrepreneurs had a much harder time securing PPP loans in the programs first several months than white ones did, and [in a new paper](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3939384), economists at NYU argue that racial animus at small banks was a big source of the disparity. Controlling for geography, industry, existing relationships with lenders, and other variables, these researchers found that small banks were far less likely than big banks to lend to black-owned businesses. Moreover, small banks with automated lending processes (like the ones big banks and financial-technology companies tend to rely on) exhibited less bias than small banks where workers approve or reject loan applications, and that the effect became more pronounced in parts of the country with higher levels of racial animus.                          
                 
**The upshot, beyond the obvious outrage, could be to re-weight existing debates over how institutions perpetuate bias.** Automated and algorithm-driven systems have been under increasing scrutiny for perpetuating biases in opaque and accidental ways; these findings are a reminder that cruder human racism still likely accounts for the lions share of racial injustice in America.

Her complaints center around the allegation that Facebook takes few if any steps to curb hatred and disinformation in smaller and developing countries, leaving citizens of those countries much more vulnerable to corrupt political leaders than larger countries with more robust regulators. Zhang detailed and published her concerns in a lengthy online memo after Facebook fired her, prompting Facebook to retaliate by asking her hosting service and domain to zap her website.

We all know people affected by cancer& and have probably donated to cancer research fundraisers. Yet we dont always understand what is happening in cancer research and how our loved ones may be helped.                        
                 
Thats why we, at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute launched [*Unraveled*](https://www.dana-farber.org/unraveled). This new podcast takes us beyond the news headlines to share stories about the progress of cancer research.                        
                 
Hear from the doctors, the researchers, the patients and the science involved in the breakthroughs that are transforming cancer research and providing hope for scientists and cancer patients. Hear how cancer researchers are using genetically engineered T Cells to turn a patients immune system into a cancer fighting machine. Learn about the complex process by which some cancers hijack the bodys response to oxygen deprivation, and how that discovery led to a Nobel Prize for one scientist. Listen in to hear how cancer research and care kept going even through the depths of the COVID pandemic.

**Bif-Hanger**
------------------------------------------------------------------------
**Infrastructure Judgment Day has come and (almost) gone, and in spite of House Speaker Nancy Pelosis most powerful positive-thinking rituals, both tracks of President Bidens agenda remain at a standstill.** The good news is, that means there are still two tracks.                          
                 
- A plume of black coal dust emanated from the Capitol on Thursday, indicating that Sen. Joe Manchin (D-WV) had a new offer. Or, an old one: According to [a Politico report](https://www.politico.com/news/2021/09/30/manchin-proposed-15t-topline-number-to-schumer-this-summer-514803), Manchin told Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer back in July that he wanted to limit the reconciliation package to a comparatively dinky $1.5 trillion. Manchin [confirmed](https://twitter.com/RiegerReport/status/1443618513768357897?s=20) thats the topline number he has in mind, lest American society succumb to an entitlement mentality, and said that he wants as many social programs in the package as possible to be means-tested. Some very cool ideas from the neighborhood yacht resident!                          
                 
- Manchins proposal calls for more modest tax increases on corporations and wealthy households, suggesting that the biggest roadblock in negotiations will be Sen. Kyrsten Sinema (D-AZ), who has indicated shes a twee-thumbs-down on corporate tax hikes big enough to fund a major bill. (Sinema, for her part, [claims to have made clear demands](https://twitter.com/SenatorSinema/status/1443630876362002432?s=20) which happen to be secret.) Manchin hoped to begin those negotiations after the bipartisan bill had passed the House, but Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-WA) exited a Thursday meeting saying that House progressives would still vote down the BIF if it came to a vote first.                          
                 
- Between progressives sticking to their guns and GOP leadership instructing members to vote against the bipartisan bill, it looks doomed to fail if Pelosi brings it to a vote on Thursday night. Pelosi [remained aggressively optimistic](https://www.washingtonpost.com/us-policy/2021/09/30/house-democrats-infrastructure-vote/) about sticking to her timeline even without an agreement on the Build Back Better act, telling reporters, I'm only envisioning taking it up and winning it. House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, meanwhile, was asked if Democrats were confident that they had enough votes and replied, nope. And scene.                          
                 
**Thankfully,** Congress was able to take time out of its busy paralysis schedule to resolve an emergency.                          
                 
- The House and Senate [both passed a stopgap bill](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/09/30/government-shutdown-congress-moves-to-pass-funding-bill.html) to keep the government funded through December 3 on Thursday, sending it to Bidens desk hours before the midnight deadline and preventing a government shutdown. The bill includes $6.3 billion for Afghan refugee resettlement, and $28.6 billion to help communities rebuild from recent natural disasters. One looming crisis averted!                          
                 
- The bill does not include a debt-limit increase, leaving a bigger looming crisis very much unaverted. On Thursday, an increasingly anxious Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen [joined calls to abolish the debt limit](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/09/30/yellen-lends-support-for-effort-to-remove-the-debt-ceiling-altogether.html) altogether, which would prevent Republicans from holding the economy hostage every few years. Schumer said hell look to hold another Senate vote on the debt ceiling [as soon as next week](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-09-30/schumer-escalates-pressure-on-debt-limit-plans-vote-next-week?sref=Ptu9QECN), which could be the vote that forces Democrats to finally rip the filibuster out of Mitch McConnells cold, purple hands, if we all do a few Nancy Pelosi-style visualization exercises.                          
                 
**Its frustrating enough that a few moderates would hold up desperately needed climate and social initiatives over the price tag when much bigger defense budgets [sail through Congress](https://twitter.com/JStein_WaPo/status/1441888623624798214?s=20) with little debate.** Its on the rest of the party to continue limiting their leverage, and its on all of us to [take Joe Manchins advice](https://twitter.com/therecount/status/1443618588280115200?s=20) and make him irrelevant: https://votesaveamerica.com/nooffyears.

**Tell the Biden Administration to Cancel Student Debt**                          
                 
The cost of higher education has grown exponentially in our country, placing it out of reach for most students and families unless they agree to take on huge amounts of debt. **Over 44 million Americans carry more than $1.7 trillion of student debt.** This crushing burden is preventing millions from buying homes, starting businesses, saving for retirement, or even starting families: And that reality falls heaviest on communities of color  particularly Black people and especially Black women  as a direct result of systemic racism.                          
                 
That's why were urging the Biden Administration to cancel up to $50,000 in student debt per borrower by the end of 2021  and we need as many people with us as possible. [Add your name to our petition to join us in action today](https://action.aclu.org/signup/pm-student-debt).                          
                 
Canceling student debt can help close the racial wealth gap by over 20 percent  securing financial stability and economic mobility for Black, Latinx, and other people of color who are disproportionately burdened by loans, while addressing the debt crisis for millions.

Greg Abbott (R-TX) cant put ARP money towards finishing Donald Trumps border wall. In Wyoming, GOP lawmakers have even proposed using relief funds to pay the federal fines of businesses that violate Bidens vaccine mandate.

For 17 of the top 20 drugs, pharma companies made more money from U.S. sales than from sales in every other country put together. Thats not because Americans are consuming more prescription drugsits because were paying a ridiculous amount for them. The analysis underscores why drug companies are fighting tooth and nail to get Democrats to drop their drug pricing provision from the Build Back Better act; the U.S. is a cash cow for Big Pharma precisely because Medicare cant negotiate lower drug prices. It also underscores why Democrats would be out of their minds to let them succeed.

"https://www.reddit.com/r/Optionmillionaires/comments/pyi06y/prepper/","upbstock","2021-09-30","prepper","Supply crunch

Things appear to be getting worse, not better, along the global supply chain, which was upended by the coronavirus pandemic over a year ago. That means entire companies and industries are going to have to deal with more extremes for the foreseeable future, making business investment a shaky decision that compounds the original problem. The volatility and uncertainty also destroy demand as prices become too high for consumers. The phenomenon, called the ""bullwhip effect,"" could end up damaging the economy in the short-term, with violent swings in a range of goods.

Warning bells: In an open letter to the United Nations General Assembly, business leaders from the International Chamber of Shipping, IATA and other transport groups (that account for more than $20T of annual global trade) sounded the alarm on the risks of a supply chain meltdown. ""We are witnessing unprecedented disruptions and global delays and shortages on essential goods including electronics, food, fuel and medical supplies. Consumer demand is rising and the delays look set to worsen ahead of Christmas and continue into 2022. Our calls have been consistent and clear: freedom of movement for transport workers, for governments to use protocols that have been endorsed by international bodies for each sector and to prioritize transport workers for vaccinations... before global transport systems collapse.""

Some of the effects were on display this week as three more U.K. energy companies were pushed out of business by sky-high natural gas prices. China is also considering raising power prices for factories as an energy shortage there has unleashed turmoil in commodities markets and prompted silicon makers to dramatically slash production. Over in the U.S., the Commerce Department delayed a decision on solar tariffs with the price of panels set to rise, while Dollar Tree (NASDAQ:DLTR) said it would sell more items above $1 to offset cost increases on a range of goods.

Do something! This time around, higher prices have put central banks between a rock and a hard place. Inflation is traditionally fought off by raising interest rates, but that might not be effective at the present given the supply chain issues taking place across the globe and the stage in the economic recovery. On the other hand, if easy monetary policy is left in place, price pressures could be compounded and result in a reduction in purchasing power or lead the economy to overheat.

Anti-vax content

The biggest social networks banned misinformation about COVID-19 early on in the pandemic, but some are taking further steps to weed out related content. Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) banned misinformation on all vaccines in February, Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) followed in March, while YouTube (GOOG, GOOGL) is now removing content that falsely alleges approved jabs are dangerous and cause severe health effects. That means videos will now be blocked on claims made against shots for diseases like measles or chickenpox, or clips that assert they cause autism, infertility or cancer.

Bigger picture: YouTube is going one step further by taking down the channels of high-profile anti-vaccine activists including Joseph Mercola and Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who experts say are sowing skepticism that's contributed to slowing vaccination rates across the country. ""Free speech is the essential core value of liberal democracy. All other rights and ideals rest upon it. There is no instance in history when censorship and secrecy have advanced either democracy or public health,"" Kennedy responded through a representative.

YouTube didn't act sooner because it was focusing on misinformation specifically about coronavirus vaccines, said Matt Halprin, YouTube's vice president of global trust and safety. ""Developing robust policies takes time... We wanted to launch a policy that is comprehensive, enforceable with consistency and adequately addresses the challenge.""

Exception to the rule: ""Given the importance of public discussion and debate to the scientific process, we will continue to allow content about vaccine policies, new vaccine trials, and historical vaccine successes or failures on YouTube.""

Making sense of it all

Continuing some strength seen in the previous session, U.S. stock index futures all climbed another 0.6% overnight following a major selloff seen earlier in the week. The Dow and S&amp;P 500 finished Wednesday up 0.2%, while tech stocks and the Nasdaq closed lower, down 0.2%. Bonds and higher rates are also in the spotlight, with the 10-year Treasury yield pulling back 3 bps to 1.51% after touching an intraday high of 1.56% on Wednesday.

Where do we go from here? ""Some investors seem ready to move on from the 'there is no alternative' mind-set that has guided their decisions since the 2008 crisis, but TINA may be harder to quit than they think,"" writes the WSJ's Jon Sindreu. Others see pockets of alternative investments that provide a yield, or jumping into attractive individual stocks, with general market returns likely to be much more muted going forward.

Analyst commentary: ""The froth has continued. Only time will tell how long that will go,"" said Mary Erdoes, JPMorgan Chase head of asset and wealth management. Since the response by central banks to the coronavirus pandemic, ""markets are up 30% to 50%, clearly not normal. We're enjoying it, but this is not a normal time period.""

""If you own entire markets with the view that asset selection doesn't matter, that's great when the markets are going up,"" added Ashbel Williams, executive director and CIO of the Florida State Board of Administration. ""But when things become really tough, and circumstances hit different industries and different companies in different ways... this is a time active management makes sense.""

Trillion-dollar coin

The House on Wednesday passed a bill to suspend the U.S. debt ceiling, though the plan looks doomed in the Senate, with only hours to go before a partial shutdown of the federal government. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen has also warned that on Oct. 18 the government will run out of money to meet its obligations to debtholders, setting up a drama-filled atmosphere on Capitol Hill. Congress has raised or suspended the ceiling 78 times since 1960, according to the Treasury, with the most recent motion taking place in 2019.

Game of chicken: Democrats are struggling to get the votes needed in the Senate if they go at it alone since they need all 50 senators within their caucus. Friction among party members over the amount of spending, as well as whether to tie the procedure to infrastructure or social programs and climate policy is also creating some theatrics. For their part, Republicans want to tie the debt ceiling increase to Democrats' massive legislation, which would put a spotlight on the party if they can't get it together ahead of the 2022 midterm elections (or would take the blame if the U.S. defaults).

""While I am hopeful that common ground can be found that would result in another historic investment in our nation, I cannot - and will not - support trillions in spending or an all or nothing approach that ignores the brutal fiscal reality our nation faces,"" critical centrist Sen. Joe Manchin (D., W. Va.) said in a statement.

Has the U.S. ever defaulted? While the technicals are always debated, and some say the U.S. has never formally defaulted, there were some scenarios in the past that could resemble it. The first time was in 1790, when the U.S. defaulted on its external debt obligations, while during the Great Depression in 1933, America had another domestic debt default related to the repayment of gold-based obligations. Some consider President Nixon's refusal in 1971 to redeem dollars for gold to constitute a partial default, while the U.S. was said to default on some Treasury bills in 1979.

Trillion-dollar coin: Echoing an idea that was originally floated during the debt ceiling crisis of 2011, there has been renewed talk in Washington of producing a very high-value currency to avoid the debt ceiling. Basically, the Treasury would mint a $1T platinum coin (under commemorative clauses), deposit it at the Federal Reserve, and the asset swap would result in an extra $1T to cover a big portion of Washington's bills. While not illegal, the accounting gimmick would be unprecedented, threaten the checks and balances of Congress and open a Pandora's box about all of public finance.

"https://www.reddit.com/r/HeatherCoxRichardson/comments/pzclad/september_30_2021_thursday/","thinkingstranger","2021-10-01","September 30, 2021 (Thursday)"," ""Tonight, President Joe Biden signed into law a bill that extends funding for the government until December 3, 2021. The government wont shut down tomorrow.  
In the Senate, Republican Tom Cotton (R-AR) tried to amend the measure to stop aid for Afghan refugees who were evacuated to the United States. That amendment reflected the demands of former president Donald Trump, who insisted that Republicans should oppose the bill, calling it a major immigration rewrite that allows Biden to bring anyone he wants from Afghanistan for the next yearno vetting, no screening, no securityand fly them to your community with free welfare and government-issued IDs. Trump suggested they would bring horrible assaults and sex crimes that would be just be the tip of the iceberg of whats coming if this isnt shut down.  
For all their talk of concern about taking care of our Afghan allies during the evacuation of Afghanistan, all 50 Republican senators voted for Cottons measure. Democrats killed it on a strict party line vote.   
Senator Roger Marshall (R-KS) also tried to amend the bill. He wanted to prohibit the use of federal funds to implement vaccine requirements for the coronavirus. This failed, too, but only after all Republicans voted for it.   
The Senate went on today to confirm Rohit Chopra to direct the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) for a five-year term. Chopra worked with Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) to establish the CFPB after the financial crisis of 2008, and in its first five years it recovered about $11.7 billion for some 27 million consumers. Former president Trump appointed former South Carolina representative Mick Mulvaney to head the bureau while he was also the director of the Office of Management and Budget; when he was in Congress, Mulvaney had introduced legislation to abolish the bureau. At its head, Mulvaney zeroed out the bureaus budget and set about dismantling it.   
When he took office, Biden began to rebuild the bureau and, in mid-February, appointed Chopra to head it, but Republicans objected to him. Now, more than seven months later, with Republicans insisting he would be anti-business, Vice President Kamala Harris cast the deciding vote to confirm his appointment.   
The rest of the congressional day was consumed with Democrats trying to hash out a final version of the Build Back Better infrastructure bill. While the Republicans largely sat the debate outthey oppose the Build Back Better plan altogetherconservative Democrats want to pass a smaller $1.2 trillion bipartisan infrastructure measure before taking up the larger $3.5 trillion measure currently under discussion. That smaller measure focuses on repairing roads and bridges and extending broadband, and lobbyists for construction industries are very keen indeed on getting it into law.   
But progressive Democrats cut a deal months ago that the smaller measure would go forward together with the larger one, and they are refusing to allow conservatives to change the terms of that deal now. The Build Back Better bill appropriates $3.5 trillion over ten years to expand child care and elder care, expand Medicare, cut prescription drug prices, provide two years of community college, extend the child tax credit, and combat climate change.   
Aside from the measure itself, there are two issues at stake in the debate over it.   
The first is about how the Democrats should interpret their victory in 2020. Conservative Democrats like Senators Joe Manchin (WV) and Kyrsten Sinema (AZ) appear to think the Democrats should limit the scope of their legislation to try to pick up moderate Republican votes in the future. More progressive Democrats, led by Pramila Jayapal (WA), who chairs the Congressional Progressive Caucus, believe the Democrats were elected to pass laws that help ordinary Americans who have felt unrepresented by Republicans.   
The other fight behind the Build Back Better measure is over how Americans choose to spend their tax dollars. Republicans, and even some conservative Democrats like Manchin, believe that spending $3.5 trillion on human infrastructure is a waste of money and that the new programs will create an entitlement mentality.  
In contrast, though, Congress spends very little time discussing the defense budget, which, at its current rate, would cost $7.78 trillion over the next ten years. That amount is significantly higher than the defense spending of any other nation in the world. In 2020, the U.S. spent $778 billion on defense, making up 39% of our overall spending. China, the country with the next highest defense budget, spent 13% of its overall spending on defense at $252 billion, India spent 3.7% at $72.9 billion, Russia spent 3.1% at $61.7 billion, and the United Kingdom spent 3% at $59.2 billion.  
At the heart of the question of how we spend our tax dollars, of course, is who pays those tax dollars. The Biden administration wants to fund the Build Back Better plan not by borrowing, but by closing tax loopholes and clawing back some of the 2017 cuts to corporate taxes and income taxes on the nations highest earners. At Rolling Stone today, reporters Andy Kroll and Geoff Dembicki wrote that political groups funded by the network of right-wing libertarian billionaire Charles Koch, who is deeply invested in fossil fuels, are pouring money and effort into killing the Build Back Better plan.  
Meanwhile, the Senate still has not taken up either of the two voting rights acts passed by the House or the Freedom to Vote Act hammered out this month by Democratic senators led by Manchin.   
Yesterday, the nonpartisan Voting Rights Lab released a report that noted the new voter suppression laws in place in 18 Republican-dominated states but focused instead on 17 new election subversion laws in 11 of those same states. Those new laws put into place the policies former president Trumps campaign demanded in 2020. They threaten election officials with prosecution if they send out mail-in ballots to anyone who has not requested one, require legislatures to agree to changes in election rules, transfer control of elections or reporting results from nonpartisan officials to political operatives, and allow candidates to demand recounts at will.   
A new law in Arizona, for example, shifts control of election litigation from the secretary of state (currently a Democrat) to the attorney general (currently a Republican). The provision is designed to sunset on January 2, 2023, when a new attorney general potentially takes office.  
When Voting Rights Lab launched a few years ago, we knew wed be busy tracking many disturbing, and oftentimes veiled efforts to suppress the vote of historically excluded Americans, the report concludes. What we couldnt have anticipated at that time was that current officeholders would warp the election process itself&.' ","HeatherCoxRichardson",3,3,0,1,0,0,0,0

House Minority Whip Steve Scalise argues the Democratic agenda 'should be scary to every family in America because it would raise taxes that every family would pay, not just the rich.'

House Minority Whip Steve Scalise told ""Sunday Morning Futures"" that Democrats are ""tying the infrastructure package hostage"" to the reconciliation bill and argued that linking the two ""would devastate America's economy.""

On Saturday President Biden told reporters that ""everybody is frustrated"" after two massive pieces of legislation stalled in Congress, as well as a debt limit increase, amid infighting among a divided Democratic caucus.

Biden spoke to reporters on his way to Delaware for the weekend after left-wing Democrats had moved to scupper the passage of a bipartisan $1 trillion infrastructure bill if it was voted on before a separate $3.5 trillion budget reconciliation bill packed with left-wing priorities on social spending and climate changes, along with significant tax increases for wealthier Americans. 

The latter bill would have been advanced using the budget reconciliation process, meaning it would only need 50 votes in the Senate, and therefore avoid a Republican filibuster. It would, however, require every one of the 50 Senate Democrats to be on board.

That unity looked in doubt this week due to objections to the sky-high price tag from moderate Democrats including Sen. Kyrsten Sinema, D-Ariz. and Joe Manchin, D-W. Va. who are seeking to bring the price down. Without their support, the legislation is likely dead on arrival in the Senate, since the bill is not designed to garner Republican support.

But the progressive Democrats refused to back the infrastructure bill until there is agreement on the enormous reconciliation package, meaning it wouldn't have the votes to pass the House.

Scalise stressed to host Maria Bartiromo that the two being linked amounts to ""a multitri(...)

Close to 700,000 Americans have been confirmed to have died from Covid-19, with the actual number likely higher. Despite the wide availability of vaccines, deaths in recent months have been overwhelmingly among the unvaccinated, and concentrated in the South, where shots have lagged other parts of the country. California just mandated vaccines for schoolchildren once shots are approved for their age group, becoming the first state to require such inoculations.

Sean Hannity offers analysis in his 'Opening Monologue' on 'Hannity'

In his ""Opening Monologue"" on Friday, host Sean Hannity warned that President Biden's continued pleas to his party to pass trillions of dollars representing a socialist takeover of the American economy and social programs is more proof he cares only about himself and not about the future generations left paying for his monstrous expenditures, nor the current generation that will be hit hard by its repercussions.

""Joe Biden is much more worried about his sinking poll numbers"" he said. ""This has gone so bad so fast, even I can't believe it... We are on the brink now"" he said on ""Hannity"".

""Border crisis, jobs crisis, inflation crisis, crisis in Afghanistan -- And now, a crisis in the Washington swamp as his fellow socialist Democrats are in a full-on civil war.""

Hannity noted that the only two remaining moderates in the Democratic Party, Sens. Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona and Joe Manchin III of West Virginia have for the time being essentially slowed the remaining Democratic majority's lurch toward socialism.

""That's why today, he limped over to Capitol Hill and begged lawmakers to pass his insane $3.5 trillion ""Build Back Better"" Socialist Spending Proposal -- what could go wrong!? Everything Joe touches turns out just great.""

Hannity noted that Biden's apparent disdain for the American people he is supposed to represent is fully evident in the bill, which allocates billions of dollars for benefits for illegal immigrants, billions for taxpayer-funded family leave and government jobs for young ""climate warriors.""

""Joe thinks that this big government, socialist, spending bill will be a historic political win for him  he doesn't care that it will cause massive inflation on top of the historic inflation we're already experiencing.""

**Economic news:**

US: Congressional Democrats face the hard work of paring back the White Houses sweeping infrastructure and social agenda in the week ahead, but have yet to agree on a target size for their multi-trillion-dollar spending bill.

Democrats said on Friday that their sweeping bill intended to bolster the social safety net and fight climate change will need to be trimmed from a $3.5 trillion goal, perhaps to closer to $2 trillion, following a visit by the president to Capitol Hill to sell his agenda.

But they have come no closer to agreement on that figure over the weekend.

Progressive (NYSE:PGR) Democratic Senator Bernie Sanders, chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, told ABC News Sunday that $3.5 trillion should be a minimum. But I accept there is going to have to be give and take.

Moderate Democrat Joe Manchin said his top line for the package is $1.5 trillion, while fellow moderate Krysten Sinema has not committed publicly to a number.

Eurozone: Britain will threaten on Monday to dispense with some of the terms of its agreement overseeing post-Brexit trade with Northern Ireland, saying they have become too damaging to retain.

In a speech to the governing Conservative Party conference in the northern English city of Manchester, Brexit minister David Frost will urge the EU to help find an agreed solution to the problems with the deal, according to a party statement.

He will warn that tinkering at the edges will not fix the fundamental problems with the Protocol, the statement said.

The British government has been urging the bloc for months to renegotiate the terms of the so-called Northern Ireland protocol, which governs trade between Britain and its province, which borders EU member Ireland.

Kyrsten Sinema (D-AZ) have [refused to offer any specificity](https://www.politico.com/news/2021/09/28/manchin-sinema-dems-biden-514574) about what they *would* support, and have instead objected to the $3.5 trillion proposals [general vibes](https://twitter.com/mkraju/status/1443322646033276934) or [adorably refusing](https://twitter.com/frankthorp/status/1443294107733053440?s=20) to say anything at all. Manchin would much [prefer to delay those negotiations](https://twitter.com/mkraju/status/1443234952540266503?s=20) until hes already gotten everything he wanted: All we need to do is pass the bipartisan infrastructure bill, sit down, and start negotiating in good faith. That's it. In other words, why cant progressives simply trust that centrists will hold up their end of the deal?                          
                 
- Mostly because of everything else they keep saying and doing! Manchin [claimed to be unaware](https://twitter.com/burgessev/status/1443302705187917829) of any deal to link the two bills together, while in the same breath explaining that the deal precluded him from sabotaging the part he didnt like. Never heard of it. That two of them would be together? Why do you think we worked so hard to separate them?"" (*Keke Palmer voice*) Sorry to this plan. The standoff over the infrastructure agenda has gotten so messy that Biden [canceled a trip to Chicago](https://twitter.com/Yamiche/status/1443010330381234182?s=20) on Wednesday to devote his full attention to figuring out what the fuck Kyrsten Sinema wants.                          
                 
**At least federal employees can almost breathe a tentative sigh of relief,** maybe!                          
                 
- Everything is still chaos, but the Senate [could vote later tonight](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/29/us/politics/debt-limit-spending-bill.html) on a bill to keep the government funded past the Thursday deadline. Democrats have stripped the debt limit increase that (outrageously) prompted Republicans to filibuster the whole bill earlier this week, so it should now be possible to pass it in time to avert a government shutdown. Just in case, the White House has [issued a contingency plan](https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/pandemic-response-shutdown/2021/09/29/a9a8be24-20a8-11ec-b3d6-8cdebe60d3e2_story.html) for how health agencies will keep the federal coronavirus response operational if funding runs out.                          
                 
- The flipside is that Democrats will need to find another way to solve the debt-limit problem before October 18, when the economy is scheduled to explode. On Wednesday the House [passed a standalone bill](https://www.cnn.com/2021/09/29/politics/house-vote-debt-ceiling/index.html) to suspend the debt limit, after a handful of moderates [threatened to vote it down](https://www.politico.com/news/2021/09/29/nancy-pelosi-debt-ceiling-514659), but unless Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell abandons his filibuster (or Democrats take away the option), its doomed in the Senate. The House vote does, however, show that Democrats have the votes to attach the debt limit increase to the reconciliation bill, if they decide to go that route.                          
                 
**ts a good sign for progressives (and the country) that Pelosi seems prepared to delay Thursdays BIF votethat arbitrary deadline served only to delink the two bills and gave a few rogue centrists an opportunity to hijack the party agenda.** Preventing a shutdown and a default are the real emergencies; getting Build Back Better across the finish line should take as long as it takes.

US President Joe Biden has suffered a setback after Congress delayed a vote on a $1tn infrastructure plan.

Part of his Democratic Party refuses to move forward with the plan until Congress signs off on a separate $3.5tn plan on welfare and climate change.

That plan is at the heart of the party's agenda for government and passions are high among its liberal and centrist wings.

Centrists want to scale the legislation back radically.

The $1tn public works bill, which would apply to routine transportation, broadband, water systems and other projects, enjoys wide support but liberal Democrats are linking it to their more ambitious welfare and climate change bill.

That bill would raise taxes on corporations and the rich, investing the revenue in a broad array of social programmes, including early childhood education, universal preschool, government-funded two-year college education, paid family and medical leave, an expansion of government health insurance and environmental spending.

President Biden and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi have been trying to reconcile the liberals with the centrists.

Reflecting the centrist position, Senator Joe Manchin said he was ready to meet the president less than halfway, at $1.5tn. He described the proposed figure of $3.5tn as ""fiscal insanity"".

Sen Bernie Sanders, a leading liberal, said the issue was ""not a baseball game"" but ""the most significant piece of legislation in 70 years"".

A fellow liberal, Representative Ilhan Omar, said: ""Trying to kill your party's agenda is insanity. Not trying to make sure the president we all worked so hard to elect, his agenda pass, is insanity.""

The House will be back in session on Friday when efforts to push through the bills will resume.

""We are not there yet, and so, we will need some additional time to finish the work, starting tomorrow morning first thing"" White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki said in (...)

**Rush Week**
------------------------------------------------------------------------
**Will the government shut down? Will President Bidens entire agenda, crammed into two bills, pass in the House of Representatives? Will Republicans continue threatening to collapse the global economy for no good reason?** Find out on this weeks episode of America: Normal, Functioning Country.                          
                 
- Step one: Congress has to pass legislation to extend annual funding for the federal government, or many government operations will shut down at midnight on Thursday. Last week the House passed a bill to do just that. But they paired it with an increase to the national debt limit, and so [Republicans in the Senate filibustered it today](https://news.yahoo.com/republicans-filibuster-bill-averting-government-163916781.html), because otherwise how would they take the economy hostage?                          
                 
- Since the deadline to increase the debt limit is still about three weeks away, Democrats are likely to strip that provision from the funding bill. That should leave plenty of time to get it passed into law by the September 30 shutdown deadline, though its always possible Republicans will exploit Senate rules to delay passage, which would bring us to the brink of a shutdown, or just beyond.                          
                 
- From there, things get murkier. Democrats can either play chicken with Republicans over the debt limit, or settle on a way to increase the debt limit with 50 votes. One, labor-intensive option would be to [amend the filibuster-proof budget procedures they adopted to pass the Build Back Better agenda with 50 votes](https://www.axios.com/shutdown-plan-b-701aa117-a7ee-49b5-b54a-c1e788660950.html), and tack a debt-limit increase on to that bill. Another, much simpler option, would be to abolish the filibuster and increase the debt limit at their leisure.                          
                 
**Speaking of Build Back Better,** we should also know more about what the final bill will look like and if and when it will pass this week.                          
                 
- Thanks to a commitment Speaker Nancy Pelosi made to a band of centrist Democrats last month, the House will vote on the Senate infrastructure bill on Thursday, the same day government funding is set to expire. That means theres a pretty good chance the House will also vote on a finalized version of the Build Back Better act this week. House progressives have promised to vote down the infrastructure bill unless it passes in tandem with Build Back Better, with a commitment from Senate Democrats to adopt it in short order. As Pelosi [explained in a letter to Democrats](https://www.speaker.gov/newsroom/92621-0), We are now working together with the Senate and the White House on changes to this historic legislation...which includes the Child Tax Credit, child care, paid family and medical leave, home health care, universal pre-K and more.                          
                 
- One minor advantage of using Build Back Better as a vehicle for increasing the debt limit is itll make it harder for the [Sens. Kyrsten Sinema (D-AZ) or Joe Manchin (D-WV)](https://twitter.com/kaitlancollins/status/1442550926951206921?s=20) to attempt any funny business like voting down the biggest chunk of Bidens agenda while doing a little curtsy thing. It would also prevent the Senate in general from dragging its feet with Build Back Better, since the debt limit absolutely has to be increased by mid-October.                          
                 
**If we get through the week without a government shutdown, and with the bipartisan infrastructure bill off to the White House for Bidens signature, itll be a pretty decent sign that the Build Back Better act will follow suit in October.** Otherwise, well have entered some really choppy waters.

**Urgent fights unfolding in Texas  join the ACLU today**                          
                 
Friend                          
                 
**What's happening in Texas at this moment should concern all of uswhether you live in the state or elsewhere.**                          
                 
Gov. Greg Abbott called a special legislative session to order this summer, overtly aimed at reviving a slew of anti-civil rights bills that were blocked in the state's last regular session.                          
                 
The bills in this new session attack voter rights, transgender rights, reproductive freedom, critical race theory, and much more. They're blatantly consistent with similar attacks that we've seen unfold across the states this year  and it has led many lawmakers to temporarily leave Texas to break quorum and block such bills from passing.                          
                 
At this urgent time, alongside our Texas affiliate and advocates like you, the ACLU is moving fastboth at the legislature and in courtand we need advocates like you with us. [**Add your name today to join the fight**](https://action.aclu.org/signup/pm-fight-for-civil-rights).                          
                 
Here's what you should know so far:                          
                 
- **Defending abortion access:** As events continued to unfold in the legislature's special session, the ACLU and the ACLU of Texas filed a lawsuit with partners challenging Senate Bill 8a blatantly unconstitutional law that bans abortion at six weeks, before many know theyre pregnant. The bill also authorizes private citizens to sue anyone who provides an abortion beyond six weeks, abortion funds that assist patients with paying for their health care beyond six weeks, and those who help someone get an abortion beyond six weeks, including clergy or counselors who advise patients and even someone who drives a patient to their appointment including family members, friends, and rideshare drivers.                          
                 
- **Safeguarding the vote:** In the first two days of the special session, lawmakers made it clear that voter suppression was a priority by introducing two restrictive voting bills: Senate Bill 1 and House Bill 3. While our affiliate teams testified in the Texas House and Senate and joined grassroots efforts to push back against these extreme measures, the ACLU and the ACLU of Texas also began representing Mr. Hervis Rogers, a 62-year-old Black man who faces decades in prison after the state recently accused him of voting when ineligible for what was at worst an innocent mistake.                          
                 
- **Protecting transgender youth:** In addition to abortion bans and suppressive voting restrictions, roughly a dozen pieces of anti-transgender bills have made their way into the Texas legislature again during this session, including several that would ban trans youth from their right to play school sports. While our teams on the ground work with fellow activists to fight against these bills, our legal team is also prepping to litigate if any of these cruel and unnecessary bills should become law, just as we have in four other states so far this year.                          
                 
What happens in one state like Texas can have a ripple effect across all of them, especially at a time when lawmakers are clearly leveraging state law for their own anti-civil liberties agenda. **We need you on our team as we keep fighting in all 50 states, D.C., and Puerto Rico  [add your name today to join us](https://action.aclu.org/signup/pm-fight-for-civil-rights) so we can act quickly at a moment's notice, wherever we're needed.**

**Under The Radar**
------------------------------------------------------------------------
**The fact that Joe Manchin remains a key obstacle to enacting President Bidens agenda is ironic, in the Alanis sense of the word, considering that [Build Back Better is basically a recipe for all that ails his home state of West Virginia](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/manchin-biden-west-virginia-child-care-hcbs-poverty_n_614e2e70e4b03dd7280afa11).** The bills extension of Bidens enhanced child tax credit, and its other child-care provisions, would be particularly valuable in a state where high poverty levels make it extremely difficult for working parents to raise their children. The tax credit alone could lift 23,000 West Virginia children out of poverty, and another measure to cap out-of-pocket child-care spending would more than halve weekly expenses for parents, which currently average $198 per week. The Century Foundation gave West Virginia (along with four other states) an F rating for its care policies, and the best way to keep it there would be for Manchin to gut or kill Build Back Better.

Until this election, the SDP and CDU had governed in coalition, and SDPs leader, Olaf Scholz, served as Merkels finance minister, suggesting the new government will not differ radically from the old one. But after Sundays results were tallied, Scholz called on CDU to step aside and enter the opposition.
