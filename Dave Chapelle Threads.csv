The Kavernacle, a leftist youtuber, posted a video where he criticizes Dave Chappelle. Well, it's actually a long video where he criticizes woke capitalism and how companies publicly claim to support LGBT people while platforming anti-lgbt voices like Chappelle, Joe Rogan, and Steven Crowder. But most people in the comments focus on Dave.

The few positive comment threads are just circlejerking about how Crowder isn't funny. But most threads are collapsed and full of wordy arguments.

[Dave is a TERF and comedian no question about it. He's also the most prominent, popular anti-white person on the planet.](https://reddit.com/r/BreadTube/comments/qb47i7/comedians_hiding_behind_comedy_to_be_transphobic/hh8lb67/)



[Over the last couple of years Ive come to the conclusion that there really is no such thing as a joke. People just like to hide their real opinions behind the guise of comedy because they dont want to suffer the social cos consequences of having those opinions. Its like that old saying goes, only the jester could make fun of the king. Comedy is not an excuse for being reactionary.](https://www.reddit.com/r/BreadTube/comments/qb47i7/comedians_hiding_behind_comedy_to_be_transphobic/hh7dcyz/)
&gt;It sounds like you have no sense of humour. Chill people with banter will always be better liked than woke scolds
&gt;&gt;Are you lost? Where do you think you are?



[Breadtube is toxic mate, they're not really socialists just scene vegans.](https://www.reddit.com/r/BreadTube/comments/qb47i7/comment/hh7ke96/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)
&gt;The point Im making is literally the stance of r/againsthatesubreddits and these fools are talking about knock knock jokes
&gt;&gt;That sub is a capitalist-liberal cesspit full of people happy to performatively 'combat' hate by just pointing at it, all while openly refusing to even discuss anything that might address or even allude to the root causes of that hatred.



[I fucking hate this guy](https://reddit.com/r/BreadTube/comments/qb47i7/comedians_hiding_behind_comedy_to_be_transphobic/hh7h1y9/)
&gt;Mind explaining why?
&gt;&gt;His takes on things are terrible and I can't stand his preachy moralistic attitude. He is the type of leftist that everyone makes fun of. He is the personification of the online woke twitter leftists that people find annoying.



[Actually I don't have a problem with trans-jokes. The statement ""trans women are women"" is a simplification that asks to be ridiculed. This has been done to death by South Park many years ago. But sadly comedians just don't get jokes anymore and treat the topic like a serious problem.](https://old.reddit.com/r/BreadTube/comments/qb47i7/comedians_hiding_behind_comedy_to_be_transphobic/hh8nr38/)



[i really do think that Anything should be allowed in a comedy show.](https://reddit.com/r/BreadTube/comments/qb47i7/comedians_hiding_behind_comedy_to_be_transphobic/hh7gqks/)
&gt;sad that i cant just voice my opinion it seems.
&gt;&gt;You just did. And people disagreed with you. That's life.
&gt;&gt;&gt;i feel bad for you guys.



[I'm really getting sick of hearing whiney kids bitch about the guy that once did a skit about ""A blind black KKK member that divorced his wife when he found out he was black because she was quote 'a n*gger lover'"" for telling jokes about other communities (which he's also always done). Why weren't you mad at his black jokes? White jokes? His trans skit wasn't nearly the edgiest joke he's ever told. Really doubt that it cracked the top 100. You're the assholes pushing the working class to fascists. Dave Chappelle, really? This is your Twitter battle now? Dave Chappelle? For fucks sake](https://reddit.com/r/BreadTube/comments/qb47i7/comedians_hiding_behind_comedy_to_be_transphobic/hh88s2k/)
&gt;Totally. Thought-policing workers for their meagre enjoyments and leisure activities, like watching a goddamned comic is a pretty sure way to alienate them from the so-called left. Dave Chapelle is a comedian. If you really want to stake the ideological class war over cancelling the most successful and loved comedian of our times, you will lose that battle.



[Just because something is bigoted doesn't mean that it shouldn't be allowed to air. The market will decide if something is truly abhorrent and people will avoid it. Things would start to look fairly dystopian reasonably quickly (like China banning boy bands) if we started banning things that offended a small portion of society. The freedom and ability to speak your mind is of paramount importance regarding this issue.](https://reddit.com/r/BreadTube/comments/qb47i7/comedians_hiding_behind_comedy_to_be_transphobic/hh7h950/)
&gt;""the market will decide"" is very curious phrase that only crops up to excuse inexcusable things.
&gt;&gt;Nope. You can just use alternatives. You don't really believe what you said in this consumer-driven world we live in, do you?
&gt;&gt;&gt;You're on a leftist sub dumbass, kindly fuck off and go whine about SJWs and how Critical Race Theory is Cultural Marxism like in Mao's China somewhere else.

I bet that employee thought they was Deep Throat. Both Deep Throats, probably. The fantasyland these people live in.

A fantasyland encouraged by the news. I would wager a supermajority of the public agrees with Chapelle, especially if they actually watched it and saw how heartfelt his plea was. I felt that it has the potential to be a ""Have you no decency?"" moment.

The only people in a furor are a tiny portion of the population who have managed to amplify their voices through--god, who knows?--guilt, a slippery slope, adolescents on twitter, a slow new days? To amplify them beyond any sense of decency or perspective. It's some fat virginal dudes LARPing in skirts, having discovered their only hope to get laid is to make up words and browbeat people with them, with their panties in a twist.

How has the monstrosity running ""Dear White People"" not been cancelled like St. Dolezal? Instead they keep mentioning its outrage, when what they should be doing is censuring it for making such a racist show.

I guess my real question is: are the people who don't give a flying fuck about all this doing themselves a disservice by not letting Netflix resoundingly know that they can't cave? I assume the viewership numbers are telling them just that, but perhaps a simple signature campaign or something like that to say to not just Netflix but the media in general, ""Most of us do not agree that the Chapelle special is in any way hateful or inciteful to violence (unless it's against white people, but that's another matter).""

I'm really getting sick of hearing about this shit. I'm getting older and I know the difference between real trans people--from friends I have had--and these faddists trying to pretend they're part of some great public moment of liberation because their lives in this failing empire have no other meaning.

That said, I support the right of free expression to all people as long as it does no harm. If you want to wear a skirt and call yourself Sheila without going through any of the internal struggle the very few people with an actual identity disorder suffer, by all means go ahead. And if I want to tell you to shut the fuck up about it, you'll have to accept that in return.

For those out of the know, comedian Dave Chapelle recently did a standup comedy show where he said some things that drew fire for being anti trans. So to protest it, Netflix employees did a walkout. It ended swiftly qith the organizer of the protest being fired.

Now whatever your opinion on Dave Chapelle may be, organizing an on the ground protest seems wierd. There are issues that need orgainized protest and issues where social media and word of mouth protests are sufficient. Even advocacy groups for queer communities didn't organise any major protest, what did these employees have in it?

Here's what i suspect happened. Netflix has over the last few years been antagonized by the right wing and conservatives. From ""too many vlack people"" to ""degeneracy"" to ""SJW agenda"" to their apparent anti trump stance conservatives have hated on Netflix.
Now Netflix wants to gain back some of their ground.

So when the backlash against the comesy show happened, Netflix acts all strongman and defends Dave Chapelle, they fire the organizer of the protest and aign up additional contracts with Dave. What should have been a one or two day hashtag protest is now mainstream news from Fox to CNN.

Through all this, conservatives, are making netflix accounts just to ""support chappelle"" and "" own the libs"".  Leftists and liberals are seeing it to see what is going on and are argueing with each other. Netflix won big with this and won back a lot of their audience.

Ive always loved Dave Chapelle. My dad loved him, and I grew up watching his show and listening to Dave Chapelle in the background. Ive probably seen and heard almost everything hes said in front of a live audience.

Theres no denying that his jokes about trans people are shitty, and that hes a transphobe, no matter what he says or how much he denies it. But at the end of the day, he didnt really say anything thats deserving of having his special taken down. Were his jokes offensive? Too much? 100%. Were they hate speech? Spreading transphobia or misinformation? No.

Dave Chapelle has never said anything that a transphobe wouldnt already agree with. His jokes are offensive, but hes not radicalizing people into being transphobic or changing the minds of formerly non-transphobic people. Hes making fun of a minority he doesnt understand and never will, and catering to an audience of the same kind, but& isnt that comedy? Havent some of the most famous movies, and books done the same thing? Robin Williams and Eddie Murphy have made jokes at the expense of lgbt people, why havent they been cancelled? He also mocks white people, and asian people, and gay men. Why wasnt he cancelled for his jokes about asian people, in the midst of a rise in asian hate crimes? Hes not Ben Shapiro or JK Rowling, purposely and dedicatedly spreading misinformation and hate. Hes a comedian making asshole jokes.

And heres the thing. People all over are *rallying* to the cause of getting his special taken down. I saw the video of the guy getting his sign destroyed. Walk-outs, boycotts, social media campaigns and opinion pieces on major news websites like CNN. *Everyone* knows about it, *everyone* has an opinion on it, *everyone* thinks this and that for this well-researched reason and why.

**But how many of you know about the murder of Mel Groves? Royal Poetical Starz? Zoey Rose Martinez?**

Mel Groves was a 25 year old black trans man, who was killed on October 11th in Mississippi. He is the 39th confirmed violent death of a trans person in 2021. He was misgendered in the news coverage and in the police reports.

Royal Poetical Starz was a 26 year old black trans woman, who was killed on October 2nd in Florida. She is the 40th confirmed violent death of a trans person in 2021. She, too, was misgendered by police and the media.

And Zoella Zoey Rose Martinez was a 20 year old latina trans woman, who was killed on August 31st in Washington. After months of being misgendered and unrecognized as transgender by the police and the media, her family came out earlier this month to confirm her identity, and she is the 41st confirmed violent death of a trans person in 2021.

All of them were shot and killed. All of them were misgendered by both police and the media. All of them have gotten less attention than Dave fucking Chapelle and his shitty trans jokes.

I only discovered Mel Groves death from [a post his brother made](https://www.reddit.com/r/ftm/comments/q7sjx3/my_trans_brother_was_murdered_on_monday/) on r/ftm. If it wasnt for that post, I wouldnt know about Mels death at all. Then, a few days later, his brother made [a post about how no one was paying attention](https://www.reddit.com/r/ftm/comments/qa3glp/my_trans_brother_mel_is_so_much_more_than_just_a/) to his brothers death- rightfully so. Someone crossposted it to r/trans, and whats in the comments? A bunch of other white trans people getting mad at the crossposter. The same kind of people who want Dave Chapelles special taken down, getting pissed at someone else reminding them that a trans man is dead. (I cant find the crossposted one to link it).

Dave Chapelle: Articles on CNN, CBS News, The Washington Post, Fox News, Reuters, etc. Pandemonium, strikes, social media movements and mass debates.

Mel Groves, Royal Poetical Starz, Zoey Rose Martinez: Articles on The Human Rights Campaign, The Advocate, PinkNews (all lgbt news sources), and a few posts on Reddit.

Why are people putting so much energy into fighting about Dave Chapelle? Why are people boycotting Netflix? Why are people getting violent in public? Why are people outraged about his bad trans jokes, but not about the deaths of actual trans people?

We are dying. We are getting shot and being misgendered afterwards. Our deaths arent being looked into, arent being reported properly, arent being seen by anyone but other trans people, and all the greater world can focus on is a comedian. We numb out death and suffering and hate crimes, read about it and move on. But when someone makes a transphobic joke, we join the firestorm. What kind of ethic is that?

And unless you knew about the death of Mel Groves, Royal Political Starz, and Zoey Rose Martinez, dont you dare say but he fuels the transphobia that killed them. Unless youre as **equally** outraged by the actual *murders* of trans people, youre a part of the problem, too.

So I decided recently to watch the Netflix special. 
Im not anti trans but there have been some high profile instances of debate being shut down in the UK (Germaine Greers no-platforming in universities) and I believe that if you are going to change century old paradigms of gender then you should bring people along and discuss it openly, not just call people TERF. I guess the point is that Im not entirely unsympathetic to Dave Chapelles point of view.

What I was confused about is the lack of any actual comedy. There is a Stewart Lee line;

"https://www.reddit.com/r/VaushV/comments/qabawq/re_vaush_on_chapelles_the_closer/","UnhappySwan457","2021-10-18","Re: Vaush on Chapelle's 'The Closer'","Hi y'all, long time listener first time poster. I'm gonna try my best to suppress the urge to type a ten page diatribe against Dave Chapelle's violence and transphobia. Im gonna fail... sorry... there are far more insightful and elegantly written thoughts to read. But I just watched some of Vaush's commentary (Oct 17th YouTube Video) and felt like I needed to add a perspective I think most missed.

Vaush correctly says that Dave IS crass to use the suicide of his friend as a comedic or political point. But this misses the larger issue. Chappelle is saying that the LGBTQ+ community (or parts of it online) bullied Daphne Dorman to death. This is not what happened - not exactly. What did happen was Dave Chapelle created a controversy that swirled around the career and identity of a hungry, 44 year old trans woman stand up comedian after his special Sticks and Stones. 

Recall that Dave talked about her in his last special and that THEN she made the Twitter post in support of him, revealing who she was. Let's put ourselves in her shoes for a second. Dorman was in a situation where she had to choose between defending internationally famous movie star, comedian and career friend Dave Chappelle from a potentially costly controversy... or calling out his transphobia/staying silent and potentially alienating all his allys and connections and audience. And get dog piled by TERFs (likely happened even as she defended Dave, btw). Kind of an impossible situation. She was doomed to alienate a core community she relied on no matter what she did or said. And the result? she committed suicide.

Now, two years later, Dave desperately needs to rewrite history so that a nameless famous mob of queer people killed his 'friend' and that he's just telling harmless jokes. How can you just... ignore that? Like, the CEO of Netflix saying these specials do no harm is demonstrably false and is continuing actual violence.

Lets back up... maybe you think I'm crazy to suggest Daves words and actions (which he profited enormously from) led to Daphne's death. Well, Do you agree with him that the trans community bullied a trans woman to death (perfect transphobic propaganda btw)? Or do you agree with me that the only singular person who had the power to have avoided or stopped all this anytime before Dorman died was Dave. That Dorman was damned by Dave. I hope most rational, compassionate folk will agree with the latter.

And see... THAT'S the truly sick thing that happened in 'The Closer' and once you see it you can't NOT see it. much of his disjointed dialogue and anecdotes on trans issues make alot more sense when you see him as trying to paint Trans Woman and Trans Allies as irrational, dangerous and a literal threat. As him personally trying to avoid guilt and externalize blame he clearly still feels. Right after the 'Beyond Pussy' joke Chappelle suggested Dorman would have laughed with him on that one. That mad me angry. Maybe she would have but she's dead. And he's literally painting a smile on a dead trans woman face and pretending like she's in on the joke... really doesn't matter if the joke has 'Bones'. He's taunting us. He's painting this as if it's a 'cancel culture' issue and practically begging for more backlash, more trans woman to react. To prove him 'right'. This isn't comedy at all, Vaush. It's carefully placed all around actual comedy, but THIS isn't funny.

Please. understand that Dorman begged us all in her suicide note to NOT blame anyone. She just wanted it all to stop. Understand that I HATE blaming Dave for her death, but he just put out an international special that argues trans people online bullied her to death. that is EXACTLY what she didn't want Dave to do. He's not letting it stop... I feel like... I have to say something. It's clear Dave feels guilt on some level - he's paying for Daphne's childs schooling - but he won't change and is doubling down on the harm. Spinning these lies about the LGBTQ community to spare his ego and externalize that guilt. It's just... evil. 

He even misgenders Dorman at least once, while he claims her as a 'member of his tribe' - as if we are somehow at odds - but all he's done is protect and enrich himself off of Daphne Dorman. It all makes sense why he's screaming team TERF. He hates trans people. He's scared of us and scans for our presence. See's us as a threat. And to him it is not a joke. He literally says exactly this:

""Im gonna tell you right now, and this is true& these transgenders& the n×ggas want me dead. I got to tell you, Im very worried about it. Im not even joking with you. Every time I come out onstage, I be scared. I be lookin around the crowd, searching. For knuckles and Adams apples to see where the threats might be coming from. A n×gga came up to me on the street the other day. He said, 'Careful, Dave, they after you.' I said, 'What?' 'One they, or many theys?'""

Netflix doesn't care about the lives, safety or well being of trans people - period. Worse the CEO thinks there's no harm in putting out specials that tell people they should be ""scared"" of the ""threat"" of trans women. Even as Netflix's own trans employees try to explain it to the CEO and walk out - they ignore them, silence them and put out statements saying they see no harm. And laugh and call it all a joke. I refuse to send money to such a company.

Daphne Dorman committed suicide after Sticks and Stones. *Because* of Dave Chappelle and his special... which created the entire controversy that swirled around her identity and career. And now, as a 'joke', Dave literally blames the LGBTQ community for bullying her to death in another Netflix special. But sure! That's a joke. Sure! These specials do ""no real world harm""... no harm to Cis people maybe. It's clearly a highly personal and political attack from where I stand.

No. The entire 'joke' and defense of it is carefully crafted transphobic propaganda - Dorman is dead because of Chappelle and his 'jokes' and the entire controversy CHAPELLE and NETFLIX created and made money on. Dave is proud of the guilt payments to her family, using them as proof of how he doesn't really hate trans people. How conveinent to toss some pocket change. He recognizes - at least on some level - he was responsible for creating the situation. But doesn't want to take REAL resposibility for it or change his behavior at all. Doesn't think he should have to. And now they're all laughing, saying it was joke that Daphne was in on, paying off the family and re-writing history as if this stuff doesn't do any harm. It's just evil.

Pretending trans folk have ""made all this progress"" as dozens of bills pass this year to make it harder for us to get healthcare, is also evil. Trying to place LGBTQ+ progress at Odds with Racial Justice? It's not funny - it's destructive AF.

This week, on National Coming Out Day, I watched from the closet as friends and even relatives defend Dave and paint trans people as violent, overly sensitive bigots who can't take a joke and bully our own into suicide... while laughing about how weird trans bodies are. Laughing and celebrating that we can't do anything about it because Dave is 'uncancelable'. As if he's taking power back from those evil ""transgenders""; as if being a trans woman gives me any special privelage =

I've watched people I thought were allies join in on the 'fun', ARGUE vehemently what he said wasn't transphobic at all. Meaning there are many folk who watch his specials and think, ""this is an acceptable way to talk and think about trans people."" And those people live in my hometown, went to school with me; some of those folk are BARELY convinced I should even be allowed to exist. a lot don't and think I'm a danger to children that should be stomped out. So no, I'm not laughing.

This isn't a real world harm ANYONE cares about but I decided against coming out this week. I don't want to walk outside or even be seen as myself RN; I'm afraid to say anything about Chappelle with my deadname and old profiles because I'll just paint a target for harassment and might be fully outted online and in RL. If the play is gonna be to mock trans women and construct us as irrational and dangerous threats and then argue such things do no real harm - then it's clear to me those spreading that narrative are *trying* to harm me. To shame me. To keep me in the closet forever, or else. Full stop. And they won this battle.

Why are people putting so much energy into fighting about Dave Chapelle? Why are people boycotting Netflix? Why are people getting violent in public? Why are people outraged about his bad trans jokes, but not about the deaths of actual trans people?

We are dying. We are getting shot and being misgendered afterwards. Our deaths arent being looked into, arent being reported properly, arent being seen by anyone but other trans people, and all the greater world can focus on is a comedian. And the same goes for my fellow trans people. We numb out death and suffering and hate crimes, read about it and move on. But when someone makes a transphobic joke, we join the firestorm. What kind of ethic is that?

And unless you knew about the death of Mel Groves, Royal Political Starz, and Zoey Rose Martinez, dont you dare say but he fuels the transphobia that killed them. Unless youre as **equally** outraged by the actual *murders* of trans people, youre a part of the problem, too.

I have no problem with edgy humor of any kind, as long as its done well.

Disclaimer #2: Dave Chapelle is literally, EASILY my favorite comedian of all time. Ive seen everything hes done EXCEPT the new special. I understand you guys are gonna call my opinion invalid because of that, but I mean, I could pretty much predict what was gonna happen before it was released.

Dave Chapelle is a comedy legend. That much is undisputed. I cant think of another person whos so witty and can easily run circles around any other comedian in any given setting. I think his earlier specials are 100% perfect all the way through, trans jokes warily included.

That said, Dave should be better than this.

In the first few Netflix specials he made a couple jokes about trans people and how they were annoyed by his jokes. These were a sideline to the main event which was a usual chapelle special, jokes about his family, his childhood, whatever, all wrapped up into an overarching theme. 

When those specials released, he was in a different time period than his older ones. The special generated a decent amount of outrage now, due to the fact that trans people were becoming more widely accepted at that point.

Heres where the problem began:

Dave has always been known for his morals especially in the face of a lot of money. Hes generally not willing to sell himself out or change his ideas to fit a mold that someone with a lot more money than him wants them to fit. Now if he CHOOSES to change those ideas for himself, thats not selling out, its considered a change in direction.

Dave saw the way that the trans jokes were being received, and saw the more recent advances in trans rights and acceptance in society, and a light bulb went off in his head. Daves too smart not to make this connection, and from what Im seeing on this sub, a lot of you guys arent smart enough to make the connection yourselves?

Dave did sticks and stones deliberately to invent controversy where there should have been none. The timing of its release along with the fact that the majority of it is comprised of its lowest-common-denominator, boomer-esque alphabet people jokes, was a quick and easy way to give himself an absurd amount of publicity that your average Dave special wouldnt be receiving. These jokes are not well-crafted, theyre not the type of trans jokes that trans people can laugh with (remember the joke where Dave fucked a trans woman he met in the club? Havent seen many of those recently) and theyre bordering on being hateful. Hence all the gay and trans people coming out of the woodwork on Twitter to say that they WERE huge chapelle fans, but, respectfully, he fell off. And thats a big part of the consensus is that they dont feel like Dave is laughing WITH them anymore.

Making these jokes in 2021 is like going back in time to 1963, at the height of the civil rights movement to make jokes about black people. Its such a pivotal, tense, and scary time for trans people and trans acceptance overall, that jokes arent really a good thing to be making right now, especially derogatory ones. Saying everyone in this room came through the legs of a female and expecting that to be some sort of gotcha shows a stunning and frankly disappointing lack of research from daves side, because Female (sex) and woman (gender) are two different things. One is biological, and one is a social construct and identity that was invented by people (and thats not even going into the differences in neural makeup that align better with their presented gender than their assigned one). Unfortunately for republicans and bigots alike, trans people are backed by science.

His jokes are becoming more and more basic and pointless, and very cringe-inducing to the point that I dont even know if I WANT to watch The Closer. On one hand, I love Dave, but on the other hand its like watching Mozart write 2 minute pop songs because they sell better. Its a bastardization of Daves legacy and history. And by owning cancel culture hes aligning himself with a group of people that he definitely does not want to be associated with.

Ive watched Dave perform for 3 and a half hours straight with no mention of trans people, on a few different occasions. Why? Because those shows arent being released to the public. Daves not cancelling cancel culture, hes thriving on its existence. Hes not tired of not being able to say what he wants because it thrusts him into a higher position in comedy (because mindless fans eat it up under the pretense that hes saying something of value that hasnt been said by 1,001 other comedians before him) and gets him more recognition among fans who wouldnt have looked twice at him before. Hes pushing some bullshit agenda that anyone should be able to say anything with no repercussion, and Im pretty sure that Im not alone when I think you shouldnt be able to be racist, bigoted, prejudiced, homophobic, transphobic, or just an asshole overall without getting your fucking teeth knocked out. I guess Im just a sensitive libtard SJW huh?

It feels like Im being cheated as a long time fan when Dave decides to throw in the towel and go for tired, low-hanging fruit instead of writing the beautifully crafted jokes hes known for and delivering a quality special. Its lazy. With a good comedian you shouldnt know what youre gonna get before he walks onstage, he should be tackling new subject matter every time. But every time a new special comes out from now on (if he does more) I can guarantee you there will be trans jokes in it. How many times does he have to say haha trans people mad before it gets old for people? 

Anyway, there are tons of other amazing comedians that can make great content without even mentioning gay or trans people. Why? Because witty observationalists like Dave should be able to draw from literally everything. Someone like Dave, John Mulaney, Bill Burr, people who basically speak in jokes could write a good special about what happened to them yesterday. Its literally what they do. Dave is purposely choosing to write these jokes because theyre easy and theyll start shit. Its as simple as that.

When you guys come on here defending him you sound like those weird Eminem stans who INSIST that his new stuff is better than most rappers on the radio today and then you find out they dont even listen to any rappers other than Eminem. Youre lying to yourselves if you think sticks and stones wasnt miles away from something like the Bird Revelation. 

In closing, lets just agree to disagree at the very least. I still love Dave and Im sure he has great stuff left in him, well just probably never see it in a special. I dont hate him or anyone else because of the shit he says, Im just super disappointed that hes settled for making a TV dinner instead of his usual 5 course meal. Jokes like those are the fast food of comedy, and I would never have pegged him as the type of person to do something like this. Because I know hes better than that. And so do you.","DaveChappelle",0,0,0,0.35,0,0,0,21

Hes not Ben Shapiro or JK Rowling, purposely and dedicatedly spreading misinformation and hate. Hes a comedian making asshole jokes.

TW: Suicide Discussion","I think ""The Closer"" is disturbing. Why? Because, IMO, Dave Chapelle's transphobic 'comedy' killed Daphne Dorman. And he's trying to push the blame off himself and re-write history while paying off her family. Hear me out.

Dave, kind soul and trans ally that he is, supposedly 'helped' his friends career with a shoutout in Sticks and Stones. Right? Yeah, there are receipts. She was a part of HIS TRIBE, as he says. And that went great. For a short while. But how did that end up? With him 'joking' around, creating a massive controversy that ended up swirling around her trans identity and her career. She supposedly 'thrust herself' into the middle... but that's asanine. As if any comedian is just FREE of any pressure to defend an internationally famous Comedian and Movie Star like Dave Chappelle? He  talked about *her* in his special next to transphobic jokes. As if she wasn't damned no matter WHAT she said, she was going to be wrong and lose once Dave brought her into these comments publicly and directly. She was forced to choose between alienating one of her most famous career 'friends' or parts of her own community. And no matter what she had a target on her back by TERFs, the team Dave now proudly proclaims membership to. If I was put in that situation, I would be extremely distraught. But it's not as if she had the privelage of stay silent, as if Dave let her stay silent. Maybe she should have just hid and not said anything at all because being Dave's Trans Friend had big costs. But apparently that's not who she was. She didn't hide. Obviously she didnt want to alienate her 'friend' and famous colleague! Imagine if she had... imagine what her Twitter would have looked like if she dared condemn him? Imagine the hate messages she got from transphobes *regardless* of supporting Dave.

Back then and still today Dave's trying to use the 'my trans friend' defense. As if Dave doesn't know EXACTLY what he did or is doing because he's been the token minority friend before. Or maybe Dave's actually convinced himself she wasn't under any pressure to tell Dave exactly what he wanted to hear? No pressure to make the public statements defending him? OK. I don't believe it - he can't be that self unaware. Or maybe he is. Maybe he really see's himself as a some sort of multimillionaire regular Joe and Daphne being under no pressure in this situation. Maybe he believe Daphnes Twitter post so much that he really think they're on the same 'level'. Except for the fact he famously laughs and jokes about how rich and famous he is. And has for decades. Was Dorman rich and famous? Regardless, Dave *made* her choose by creating the situation and then defending 'his side' of the controversy. Invoking her existence to justify it all as if those offend just can't take a joke. No, he could have stopped this at any time with a press conference, by admiting his mistakes and taking criticism and learning. Or by just not making those 'jokes'... But his 'comedy' and 'art' were too important.

He talks like he was just a 'nobody' and that's bullshit. But! It's bullshit essential to the carefully crafted lie he tells himself and now the world. Because so long as he was just a 'nobody' back then (in 2019), so long as Daphne and him were 'on the same level', he doesn't have to see the true power relations that were at play - that he had so much more power and money and access and clout than 44-year old Dorman. That she was a hungry comedian. And that Daphne NOT defending him could risk her future and access to Dave and *his* powerful allies. Risk his audience attacking and hating HER.

In her suicide letter, she pleaded for us all not to blame anyone. Pleaded for me to NOT do what I'm doing now; for Dave to not blame anyone the way he just did in an international 'comedy' special. But if he gets to speak his 'truth' - his ego and guilt assuaging opinion about cancel culture then I get to speak mine. Dave Chappelle is paying money to her family to this day because he feels unresolved guilt - as well he should. But he's still making jokes that harm Trans people and cashing in - joking about beet juice coming out of 'fake pussys' like a middle schooler and insisting she'd have loved the joke. What. The. Fuck. She's dead Dave - what gives you the right? did the check you signed to her family give you the right to paint a smile on her mouth? Does anyone's friendship let them put controversial words in their dead friends mouth? To use their sucide as political point to help your career? Apparently money and a Netflix special and some rich friends will let you do a lot these days.

You know what I see in Dave? Someone who can't admit the wrongs he's done and is doubling down on them. It's pretty common, especially for folks with unresolved grief and guilt. He's not just making jokes. He's blaming the trans community for Dormans suicide, reiterating that it's a serious political issue, and then mocking the trans community, daring them to try to 'cancel him' again. He spent a good 1/4 to 1/2 of the special on it. And he almost HAS to.

Like... he isn't JUST transphobic - he has trans blood on his hand and he still needs to joke about it because admitting he was wrong is too hard. admitting he was responsible for what happened the last time he made these types of 'jokes' would mean admitting the only person who could of avoided the controvery, the only person who was truly in control of it from its inception... was him. He wants to... no he NEEDS to wipe his hands clean with guilt money payments and rewrite history. He needs to come out in his 'comedy' special and blame a nameless, faceless crowd who killed his 'friend'. Frankly, it may be the single whitest thing he's ever done. His rambling insults arent just backward, incomplete ways of atoning for the harm he caused - they are his only way of moving 'forward'.

Chapelle needs to blame the 'online mob' and thats convenient because then he gets to blame trans folk and trans allies for a dead trans woman. A perfect 'Win' for someone who hates trans folk. Because he needs to externalize his guilt and refuses to take responsibility for the 'jokes' that caused the controversy in the first place; for him creating the entire situation and letting it play out. And cashing in while laughing. Blaming 'cancel culture' is a convenient scape goat, one that also helpfully inoculates him from criticism. Which makes it all the more malicious; Dave knows exactly what he's doing and saying. And he well knows the costs.","lgbt",16,16,0,0.72,0,0,0,2

This Sub is Being Targeted
Today Im seeing post after post that appears to be targeted propaganda to dilute the message of the sub, and to drive wedges between its members.

From erasure of Black struggles, to dismissal of the Netflix trans walkout, to complaining that this sub has become too political or too left vs right. I hope the mods here and the member base are ready to hold firm to what this sub is supposed to be about, and not allow misinformation and bad actors disrupt it.

EDIT: Holy cow! I expected this to get maybe 50 upvotes at most and fizzle away. Im glad to be validated in that Im not just crazy.

Just wanna say before I head off to sleep, to all the folks who came here just to defend Dave Chapelle: Get bent. Solidarity means lifting all of us up. Trans people are workers too.

Ive always loved Dave Chapelle. My dad loved him, and I grew up watching his show and listening to Dave Chapelle in the background. Ive probably seen and heard almost everything hes said in front of a live audience.

Theres no denying that his jokes about trans people are shitty, and that hes a transphobe, no matter what he says or how much he denies it. But at the end of the day, he didnt really say anything thats deserving of having his special taken down. Were his jokes offensive? Too much? 100%. Were they hate speech? Spreading transphobia or misinformation? No.

Dave Chapelle has never said anything that a transphobe wouldnt already agree with. His jokes are offensive, but hes not radicalizing people into being transphobic or changing the minds of formerly non-transphobic people. Hes making fun of a minority he doesnt understand and never will, and catering to an audience of the same kind, but& isnt that comedy? Havent some of the most famous movies, and books done the same thing? Robin Williams and Eddie Murphy have made jokes at the expense of lgbt people, why havent they been cancelled? He also mocks white people, and asian people, and gay men. Why wasnt he cancelled for his jokes about asian people, in the midst of a rise in asian hate crimes? Hes not Ben Shapiro or JK Rowling, purposely and dedicatedly spreading misinformation and hate. Hes a comedian making asshole jokes.

And heres the thing. People all over are *rallying* to the cause of getting his special taken down. I saw the video of the guy getting his sign destroyed. Walk-outs, boycotts, social media campaigns and opinion pieces on major news websites like CNN. *Everyone* knows about it, *everyone* has an opinion on it, *everyone* thinks this and that for this well-researched reason and why.

**But how many of you know about the murder of Mel Groves? Royal Poetical Starz? Zoey Rose Martinez?**

Mel Groves was a 25 year old black trans man, who was killed on October 11th in Mississippi. He is the 39th confirmed violent death of a trans person in 2021. He was misgendered in the news coverage and in the police reports.

Royal Poetical Starz was a 26 year old black trans woman, who was killed on October 2nd in Florida. She is the 40th confirmed violent death of a trans person in 2021. She, too, was misgendered by police and the media.

And Zoella Zoey Rose Martinez was a 20 year old latina trans woman, who was killed on August 31st in Washington. After months of being misgendered and unrecognized as transgender by the police and the media, her family came out earlier this month to confirm her identity, and she is the 41st confirmed violent death of a trans person in 2021.

All of them were shot and killed. All of them were misgendered by both police and the media. All of them have gotten less attention than Dave fucking Chapelle and his shitty trans jokes.

I only discovered Mel Groves death from [a post his brother made](https://www.reddit.com/r/ftm/comments/q7sjx3/my_trans_brother_was_murdered_on_monday/) on r/ftm. If it wasnt for that post, I wouldnt know about Mels death at all. Then, a few days later, his brother made [a post about how no one was paying attention](https://www.reddit.com/r/ftm/comments/qa3glp/my_trans_brother_mel_is_so_much_more_than_just_a/) to his brothers death- rightfully so. Someone crossposted it to r/trans, and whats in the comments? A bunch of other white trans people getting mad at the crossposter. The same kind of people who want Dave Chapelles special taken down, getting pissed at someone else reminding them that a trans man is dead. (I cant find the crossposted one to link it).

Dave Chapelle: Articles on CNN, CBS News, The Washington Post, Fox News, Reuters, etc. Pandemonium, strikes, social media movements and mass debates.

Mel Groves, Royal Poetical Starz, Zoey Rose Martinez: Articles on The Human Rights Campaign, The Advocate, PinkNews (all lgbt news sources), and a few posts on Reddit.

Why are people putting so much energy into fighting about Dave Chapelle? Why are people boycotting Netflix? Why are people getting violent in public? Why are people outraged about his bad trans jokes, but not about the deaths of actual trans people?

We are dying. We are getting shot and being misgendered afterwards. Our deaths arent being looked into, arent being reported properly, arent being seen by anyone but other trans people, and all the greater world can focus on is a comedian. And the same goes for my fellow trans people. We numb out death and suffering and hate crimes, read about it and move on. But when someone makes a transphobic joke, we join the firestorm. What kind of ethic is that?

And unless you knew about the death of Mel Groves, Royal Political Starz, and Zoey Rose Martinez, dont you dare say but he fuels the transphobia that killed them. Unless youre as **equally** outraged by the actual *murders* of trans people, youre a part of the problem, too.

Was this leaked before its official release?","Like most Netflix specials, I only learn about them when they come out.  I learned about *The Closer* from a Washington Post article saying Dave doubled down on his trans jokes.  So I immediately went to Netflix and started watching.

But I started experiencing some deja vu, because I wasnt laughing.  And not because I didnt think the material wasnt funny, but because I heard it before.  *Space Jews* sounded familiar, as did *Clifford the big black nigger*.  When he started talking about the conflict with the alphabet people, that did too.  I was just writing this all off as to me reading about Chapelle in articles and watching lots of YouTube clips.  But other than the parts about Dababy  I had to Google him  it was all too familiar.  In fact I stopped watching to make sure the WashPost article wasn't a year old and I was reacting to something thats already been released.

This went on for the entire show.  The JK Rowling part was something Im *positive* Ive heard Dave talk about before, because he was explaining what a TERF is.  Then he started talking about his trans friend in Oakland.  I immediately remembered a few things about her.  That he had her open for him and she bombed. She stayed to watch his set and got drunk as fuck. And she killed herself.  And all of those memories were brought back by *The Closer*.

So Ive *had* to have seen (or heard) this content earlier.  Im not a Dave stalker, so everything Ive seen on him has either come through YouTube, this sub, or a link/comment from any of those places.  Does anyone know when/where this might have leaked from?","DaveChappelle",0,0,0,0.45,0,0,0,4

**Nips And Flux**
------------------------------------------------------------------------
**Democrats slimmed-down reconciliation package has begun to take shape, with negotiators newly hopeful about reaching an agreement by the end of the month.** A spooky-season miracle.                          
                 
- So what kind of shape is it? A substantially smaller one, for starters. President Biden told Democrats on Tuesday that he was now [aiming for a deal between $1.75 trillion and $1.9 trillion](https://www.washingtonpost.com/us-policy/2021/10/19/biden-democrats-reconciliation/), which would still include some sort of Medicare expansion, universal pre-K, and billions of dollars to address climate change (somehow), as well as narrower or shorter-term versions of the extended child tax credit, paid family leave, and affordable housing. Tuition-free community college has likely been cut from the package.                          
                 
- I haven't seen this much optimism since right before we passed the American Rescue Plan, Sen. Brian Schatz (D-HI) [said on Wednesday](https://twitter.com/sahilkapur/status/1450852000569102343?s=20). But there are still some big question marks, primarily around whether and how to stop the oceans from boiling. Now that Sen. Joe Manchin (D-WV) has dumped proposals for a clean-energy program and a carbon tax over the side of the Almost Heaven, its not clear what the bills final climate provisions will look like.                          
                 
- While were waiting, lets check in with the latest news on how Manchins climate obstruction will hurt his own constituents! In addition to dealing with [worsening, inescapable floods](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/17/climate/manchin-west-virginia-flooding.html), West Virginia residents can look forward to continuing to pay [sky-high electricity bills](https://www.cnn.com/2021/10/19/politics/west-virginia-coal-rates-manchin-climate/index.html). While most states now generate less than 40 percent of their electricity from coal, West Virginia relies on it for 89 percent of its power. The states reliance on coal might be [lining Manchins own pockets](https://theintercept.com/2021/09/03/joe-manchin-coal-fossil-fuels-pollution/), but his constituents will face unmanageable bills every winter as the cost of coal-fired power continues to rise.                          
                 
**The scramble to find Manchin-proof climate provisions isnt the only remaining tangle.**                          
                 
- Manchins insistence on means-testing every social program in the bill could have harmful side-effects beyond the obvious cruelties of things like [limiting the child tax credit](https://www.dailykos.com/stories/2021/10/20/2059268/-Manchin-may-or-may-not-be-issuing-bombshell-threats-but-he-s-definitely-complicating-Biden-s-agenda) to families making less than $60,000. (Progressives have called that number a nonstarter.) According to one analysis, the current design of Democrats child care plan [could wind up hurting middle class families](https://www.peoplespolicyproject.org/2021/10/20/democratic-child-care-plan-will-spike-prices-for-the-middle-class-by-13000/): By raising wages for child-care workers (good), it would also raise the cost of unsubsidized child care, but families earning just over their states median income would receive no subsidies for the first three years of the program, so their child-care costs would simply spike (awful).                          
                 
- A spokesperson for the House Committee on Education and Labor [defended the programs design](https://twitter.com/BenjySarlin/status/1450858293824528391?s=20), arguing that worker wages wouldnt rise abruptly enough to gouge middle-class parents before their subsidies kicked in. Best-case scenario, thats right, and means-testing just makes the plan annoyingly complicated. Worst-case scenario, thats wrong, and a whole bunch of voters discover that Democrats have accidentally saddled them with extra costs just in time for some hugely important elections. Seems like something to take a closer look at before it becomes law!                          
                 
**It looks increasingly likely that Democrats will manage to bring Smanchinema on board to pass *something*, and improve a lot of Americans lives in the process.** Whether that final deal will include the kind of game-changing climate initiative the world needsand exclude the kind of political self-own that Democrats cant affordremains to be seen.

People ask me if she killed herself because of Dave Chapelle (henceforth called DC) mentioning her in his 2019 special, because she ended her life just one week after it came out. Daphne met DC at a comedy club while he was performing..He was telling controversial jokes and she was laughing because she always had a dark sense of humor. But Daphne never told racist jokes or punched down on groups of people. She used humor to heal from pain, she told self-deprecating jokes, and used humor to educate people about trans issues. She never used humor to be hateful.

Before DCs 2019 special he really buttered her up, promising to mentor her, and take her under his wings. I was suspicious of his antics and didnt really appreciate his style of humor but I was happy for Daphne if she was happy.  >7<û@

I watched part of DCs 2019 special when it came out because Daphne was so excited for it but I couldnt even finish it because I felt like it was so offensive to different marginalized groups. But I didnt want to criticize it because I knew Daphne was excited for the shoutout, even though the mention of her was so quick you could miss it.

Then after Daphne died it was crickets from Dave Chapelle for months and years after it happened. When a group of her theatre/comedy friends threw a memorial for her in San Francisco, DC didnt say anything. When her funeral in Pennsylvania happened a couple months later, DCs team hadnt reached out to her friends or family. When we planned another memorial for her in SF, we didnt hear anything from his team. It was like if he said something about her, he would admit that he was responsible for her death. 

Im not going to say I know for sure 100% that Dave Chapelle making fun of Daphne in his 2019 special is what caused her death. I don't think it was the main cause, but who knows. Daphne had PTSD from a life of trauma and she had battled suicidal thoughts for years. I think the final blow was a combination of her losing custody of her daughter, losing her job, and dealing with a lot of transphobic harassment on the streets of  San Francisco. I lived with her, and yet I didnt know how bad she was feeling.

I heard from a friend that Dave Chapelle mentioned her last year in a stand up comedy routine, and he mentioned how he let her open for one of his stand up routines but that she bombed it. For him to patronize her, demean her, and minimize her talent AFTER her death is cruel and crass. For him to invoke her name as a free pass to continue being transphobic is beyond fucked up. =$ =$ 

In the latest Netflix special he starts off his piece about trans people with  Im not saying trans women arent women but then he calls trans vaginas beyond pussy. *rolls eyes* And he says he is a TERF (trans exclusionary radical feminist) and self describes himself as transphobic MULTIPLE TIMES in this special >,>,>,

He mentioned the story of when he met Daphne, and when he called her to invite her to open for him, and that he didnt know she was an amateur. He says she was dressed well for the performance and admits  Im transphobic and even I think she looked nice. OKAY TELL US HOW YOU REALLY FEEL.=$ =$=$ =$

This bitch bombed for 45 min straight. . that show was terrible. . but heres what impressed me. . Any other comedian Ive ever seen, if they bombed as bad as she did, would have snuck out of the theater and  gone on home and cried. But she found a seat right in front. . she laughed hard like (she didnt bomb). She was talking to me while I was performing like she was watching the TV alone, but the crowd didnt like that shit because she sucked. . =$=$

And then Daphne told a joke to a heckler and then they went back and forth and told jokes. He tells about a touching moment they had together, but then he said her performance stunk again. Thats what 4 times he said she wasnt funny?! This is how you speak about your dead friend? Then he realized she was funny after the performance by the way she genuinely interacted with the audience . then he says when she hugged him he pushed her off violently because Im transphobic. =D

My friend Daphne killed herself. .She identifies as a woman _____((Then he describes how she killed herself)),___ clearly only a man would do some gangster shit like that >,>,>,

I dont even know how he found that out because her friends and family didnt say that publicly because ITs PRIVATE AND PAINFUL! And beyond that, studies have shown that mentioning specifically how people kill themselves only causes more suicides. But Dave doesnt care.

He continues..As hard as it is to hear a joke like that, Daphne would have loved that joke Maybe she would, maybe she wouldnt but SHE KILLED HERSELF AND CANT DEFEND HERSELF ANYMORE! He goes on to say I dont know what the trans community did for her and I dont care because she was my tribe =D

He says Daphne killed herself because trans people were criticizing her on Twitter&So hes blaming trans people for causing her death? WTF. Thats some next level victim blaming / gaslighting. =!=!

He ends his mockery of her saying he said he wants to tell Daphnes daughter I knew your father and HE was a wonderful woman. >,>,>,

Dave Chapelle doesnt give a fuck about trans people. He deliberately goes out of his way to make fun of us, even making fun of his alleged friend AFTER her death. 

If you are reading this and made it this far, please take a moment to ask Netflix to remove this hateful special. Not because it might offend trans people, but because it might inspire more people to end their life. 

Daphne Dorman deserved better.

With his latest Netflix special, The Closer, the provocative comedian seems to respond to past accusations of homophobia and transphobia by doubling down. He jokes early on that DaBaby, who was dropped from music festivals for making [misinformed comments about HIV](https://www.washingtonpost.com/arts-entertainment/2021/08/02/dababy-apology-homophobic-comments-festivals/), punched the LBGTQ \[sic\] community right in the AIDS. Then, after saying DaBaby made an egregious mistake, Chappelle notes that the rapper was once involved in a shooting at Walmart.

Nothing bad happened to his career, he says. Do you see where Im going with this? In our country, you can shoot and kill a \[n-word\] but you better not hurt a gay persons feelings.

This is the disparity Chappelle would like to discuss, he adds, soon afterward clarifying to the applauding audience that he doesnt hate gay people but is instead jealous of them.

We Blacks, he says, we look at the gay community and we go & Look how well that movement is going. Look how well you are doing. And weve been trapped in this predicament for hundreds of years. How & are you making that kind of progress? I cant help but feel like if slaves had baby oil and booty shorts, we might have been free a hundred years sooner.

Jokingly referring to himself as transphobic comedian Dave Chappelle, the comic later pivots to commenting on trans people. Some of his jokes involve anatomy, such as when he compares the genitalia of trans women to vegetarian substitutes for meat products. At one point, he [defends J.K. Rowling](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2019/12/19/jk-rowling-tried-make-her-work-more-inclusive-then-she-tweeted-support-an-anti-trans-researcher/) and says hes team TERF  which stands for trans-exclusionary radical feminist  for agreeing that gender is a fact.

The special almost immediately attracted the ire of LGBTQ people and advocacy organizations.

Dear White People showrunner Jaclyn Moore, who is trans, [tweeted](https://twitter.com/JaclynPMoore/status/1445912662093729793) Wednesday that while she has loved working with Netflix, she wouldnt work with the streaming company as long as they continue to pull out and profit from blatantly and dangerously transphobic content.

Sharing an NPR review that claims the special [goes too far](https://www.npr.org/2021/10/05/1043435919/dave-chappelle-new-netflix-special-the-closer-review), GLAAD [tweeted](https://twitter.com/glaad/status/1445870767548231685?s=20) that Chappelles brand has become synonymous with ridiculing trans people and other marginalized communities. Negative reviews and viewers loudly condemning his latest special is a message to the industry that audiences dont support platforming anti-LGBTQ diatribes. We agree. The Human Rights Campaign [tweeted](https://twitter.com/HRC/status/1445760431574814731), Trans women are women. Trans men are men. Non-binary people are non-binary. CC: Dave Chappelle.

The response to such criticism is often that Chappelles comments were made in jest and are in line with his tradition of pushing the envelope. The comic himself says in the special that anyone familiar with his work should know that I have never had a problem with transgender people. If you listen to what Im saying clearly, my problem has always been with White people.

[AdChoices](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759)

Chappelle concludes The Closer with a story about his friend, the late comic Daphne Dorman, who was a White trans woman and opened a show for him in 2019. He recalls how she tweeted in his defense after he was accused of transphobia, which made her a target of criticism as well. Dorman killed herself soon afterward. In the special, Chapelle calls for more empathy.

Then, he says he will no longer joke about LGBTQ people.

Im telling you, its done. Im done talking about it, he states. All I ask of your community, with all humility: Will you please stop punching down on my people?

The use of my people captures another criticism leveled at Chappelle  that many of his jokes are hinged upon the LGBTQ community and Black people being mutually exclusive groups, all while Black members of the LGBTQ community face [heightened levels of discrimination](https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/lgbtq-rights/news/2021/07/13/501484/black-lgbtq-individuals-experience-heightened-levels-discrimination/). (At one point in the special, he says gay people are minorities until they need to be White again.)

David J. Johns, executive director of the National Black Justice Coalition, which aims to empower Black LGBTQ people, criticized Netflixs decision to carry a comedy special on its platform exhibiting what he called Chappelles lazy and hostile transphobia and homophobia.

When we fail to recognize that as long as there have been Black people weve been beautifully diverse, Johns wrote in a statement shared Thursday, its easy to accept the lie that Black trans, queer, and non-binary/non-conforming people dont exist & To be sure, all Black Lives Matter.

*Dave Chappelles Netflix Special Called Out by GLAAD, National Black Justice Coalition for Ridiculing Trans People*

You mean Dave ""Both Sides"" Chappelle, a.k.a. Dave ""Average Joe Rogan Podcast Listener's Favorite Comedian (since even they know Rogan is a god-awful comedian)"" Chapelle, a.k.a. Dave ""He's Just Asking Questions, Plus He Calls Out the Hollyweird Cabal and Media Elites"" Chappelle is a POS? Well!

I'd say how long until he's showing up at Trump rallies but he enjoys too much thinking he's above that all. I can't see him descending into partisan politics like that because he thinks he's too good for that. But this will just endear him to the chuds even more than before, which is to say quite a lot, since he's always been ""one of the good ones"" to them due to his ""skepticism"" and populist-friendly criticisms of Hollywood elites.
