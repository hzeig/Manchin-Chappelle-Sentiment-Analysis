"1","Today Im seeing post after post that appears to be targeted propaganda to dilute the message of the sub, and to drive wedges between its members.

From erasure of Black struggles, to dismissal of the Netflix trans walkout, to complaining that this sub has become too political or too left vs right. I hope the mods here and the member base are ready to hold firm to what this sub is supposed to be about, and not allow misinformation and bad actors disrupt it.

EDIT: Holy cow! I expected this to get maybe 50 upvotes at most and fizzle away. Im glad to be validated in that Im not just crazy.

Just wanna say before I head off to sleep, to all the folks who came here just to defend Dave Chapelle: Get bent. Solidarity means lifting all of us up. Trans people are workers too.",0.103,0.084
"495","As an Englishman my exposure to Dave Chapelle is the Rick James skits with Charlie Murphy. They are funny because I truly believe that Rick James was probably a lunatic and its funny to see behind the curtain of these mental celebrities (see the Vice video series on Hollywood parties.) 

So I decided recently to watch the Netflix special. 
Im not anti trans but there have been some high profile instances of debate being shut down in the UK (Germaine Greers no-platforming in universities) and I believe that if you are going to change century old paradigms of gender then you should bring people along and discuss it openly, not just call people TERF. I guess the point is that Im not entirely unsympathetic to Dave Chapelles point of view.

What I was confused about is the lack of any actual comedy. There is a Stewart Lee line;
Comedy was easier in the 80s. You just hated the conservatives. Youd go to a comedy gig and people ask
Was it funny?
No, but I agreed the hell out of it

Is this how modern American comedy works?

"584","Anybody who listens to BARPod and watched Dave Chappelle's new special probably recognized a lot of similar tropes between his experiences with the online trans community, and Jesse &amp; Katie's (""punching down,"" destroy rather than understand, going nuclear over tiny faux pas, those labeled enemies become irredeemable demons, once you're marked people can say absolutely anything they want about you with no repercussions and it will be believed)

I wonder if that special and the massive backlash it's getting online would be worth devoting an episode to? Could enough people madposting on twitter actually be enough to cause action on Netflix's end?

I think he presented great messages. The internet is not real life -- it makes people fucking insane and people who aren't terminally online tend to be way more reasonable. People are not perfect and just want to feel accepted and understood as human beings, etc. People need to be able to talk candidly, or even joke, about things they don't understand without fear of having their lives destroyed",0.112,0.103

"847","For a change let's look at a lighter issue. For those out of the know, comedian Dave Chapelle recently did a standup comedy show where he said some things that drew fire for being anti trans. So to protest it, Netflix employees did a walkout. It ended swiftly qith the organizer of the protest being fired.

Now whatever your opinion on Dave Chapelle may be, organizing an on the ground protest seems wierd. There are issues that need orgainized protest and issues where social media and word of mouth protests are sufficient. Even advocacy groups for queer communities didn't organise any major protest, what did these employees have in it?

Here's what i suspect happened. Netflix has over the last few years been antagonized by the right wing and conservatives. From ""too many vlack people"" to ""degeneracy"" to ""SJW agenda"" to their apparent anti trump stance conservatives have hated on Netflix.
Now Netflix wants to gain back some of their ground.

So when the backlash against the comesy show happened, Netflix acts all strongman and defends Dave Chapelle, they fire the organizer of the protest and aign up additional contracts with Dave. What should have been a one or two day hashtag protest is now mainstream news from Fox to CNN.

Through all this, conservatives, are making netflix accounts just to ""support chappelle"" and "" own the libs"".  Leftists and liberals are seeing it to see what is going on and are argueing with each other. Netflix won big with this and won back a lot of their audience. I'm basically sure they're the ones who caused this ri blow out on purpose.",0.079,0.13
"1114","Like most Netflix specials, I only learn about them when they come out.  I learned about *The Closer* from a Washington Post article saying Dave doubled down on his trans jokes.  So I immediately went to Netflix and started watching.

But I started experiencing some deja vu, because I wasnt laughing.  And not because I didnt think the material wasnt funny, but because I heard it before.  *Space Jews* sounded familiar, as did *Clifford the big black nigger*.  When he started talking about the conflict with the alphabet people, that did too.  I was just writing this all off as to me reading about Chapelle in articles and watching lots of YouTube clips.  But other than the parts about Dababy  I had to Google him  it was all too familiar.  In fact I stopped watching to make sure the WashPost article wasn't a year old and I was reacting to something thats already been released.

This went on for the entire show.  The JK Rowling part was something Im *positive* Ive heard Dave talk about before, because he was explaining what a TERF is.  Then he started talking about his trans friend in Oakland.  I immediately remembered a few things about her.  That he had her open for him and she bombed. She stayed to watch his set and got drunk as fuck. And she killed herself.  And all of those memories were brought back by *The Closer*.

So Ive *had* to have seen (or heard) this content earlier.  Im not a Dave stalker, so everything Ive seen on him has either come through YouTube, this sub, or a link/comment from any of those places.  Does anyone know when/where this might have leaked from?",0.083,0.087
"1118","Disclaimer #1: Im a white, straight male, like Id wager the majority of this sub is. I have no problem with edgy humor of any kind, as long as its done well.

Disclaimer #2: Dave Chapelle is literally, EASILY my favorite comedian of all time. Ive seen everything hes done EXCEPT the new special. I understand you guys are gonna call my opinion invalid because of that, but I mean, I could pretty much predict what was gonna happen before it was released.

Dave Chapelle is a comedy legend. That much is undisputed. I cant think of another person whos so witty and can easily run circles around any other comedian in any given setting. I think his earlier specials are 100% perfect all the way through, trans jokes warily included.

That said, Dave should be better than this.

In the first few Netflix specials he made a couple jokes about trans people and how they were annoyed by his jokes. These were a sideline to the main event which was a usual chapelle special, jokes about his family, his childhood, whatever, all wrapped up into an overarching theme. 

When those specials released, he was in a different time period than his older ones. The special generated a decent amount of outrage now, due to the fact that trans people were becoming more widely accepted at that point.

Heres where the problem began:

Dave has always been known for his morals especially in the face of a lot of money. Hes generally not willing to sell himself out or change his ideas to fit a mold that someone with a lot more money than him wants them to fit. Now if he CHOOSES to change those ideas for himself, thats not selling out, its considered a change in direction.

Dave saw the way that the trans jokes were being received, and saw the more recent advances in trans rights and acceptance in society, and a light bulb went off in his head. Daves too smart not to make this connection, and from what Im seeing on this sub, a lot of you guys arent smart enough to make the connection yourselves?

Dave did sticks and stones deliberately to invent controversy where there should have been none. The timing of its release along with the fact that the majority of it is comprised of its lowest-common-denominator, boomer-esque alphabet people jokes, was a quick and easy way to give himself an absurd amount of publicity that your average Dave special wouldnt be receiving. These jokes are not well-crafted, theyre not the type of trans jokes that trans people can laugh with (remember the joke where Dave fucked a trans woman he met in the club? Havent seen many of those recently) and theyre bordering on being hateful. Hence all the gay and trans people coming out of the woodwork on Twitter to say that they WERE huge chapelle fans, but, respectfully, he fell off. And thats a big part of the consensus is that they dont feel like Dave is laughing WITH them anymore.

Making these jokes in 2021 is like going back in time to 1963, at the height of the civil rights movement to make jokes about black people. Its such a pivotal, tense, and scary time for trans people and trans acceptance overall, that jokes arent really a good thing to be making right now, especially derogatory ones. Saying everyone in this room came through the legs of a female and expecting that to be some sort of gotcha shows a stunning and frankly disappointing lack of research from daves side, because Female (sex) and woman (gender) are two different things. One is biological, and one is a social construct and identity that was invented by people (and thats not even going into the differences in neural makeup that align better with their presented gender than their assigned one). Unfortunately for republicans and bigots alike, trans people are backed by science.

His jokes are becoming more and more basic and pointless, and very cringe-inducing to the point that I dont even know if I WANT to watch The Closer. On one hand, I love Dave, but on the other hand its like watching Mozart write 2 minute pop songs because they sell better. Its a bastardization of Daves legacy and history. And by owning cancel culture hes aligning himself with a group of people that he definitely does not want to be associated with.

Ive watched Dave perform for 3 and a half hours straight with no mention of trans people, on a few different occasions. Why? Because those shows arent being released to the public. Daves not cancelling cancel culture, hes thriving on its existence. Hes not tired of not being able to say what he wants because it thrusts him into a higher position in comedy (because mindless fans eat it up under the pretense that hes saying something of value that hasnt been said by 1,001 other comedians before him) and gets him more recognition among fans who wouldnt have looked twice at him before. Hes pushing some bullshit agenda that anyone should be able to say anything with no repercussion, and Im pretty sure that Im not alone when I think you shouldnt be able to be racist, bigoted, prejudiced, homophobic, transphobic, or just an asshole overall without getting your fucking teeth knocked out. I guess Im just a sensitive libtard SJW huh?

It feels like Im being cheated as a long time fan when Dave decides to throw in the towel and go for tired, low-hanging fruit instead of writing the beautifully crafted jokes hes known for and delivering a quality special. Its lazy. With a good comedian you shouldnt know what youre gonna get before he walks onstage, he should be tackling new subject matter every time. But every time a new special comes out from now on (if he does more) I can guarantee you there will be trans jokes in it. How many times does he have to say haha trans people mad before it gets old for people? 

Anyway, there are tons of other amazing comedians that can make great content without even mentioning gay or trans people. Why? Because witty observationalists like Dave should be able to draw from literally everything. Someone like Dave, John Mulaney, Bill Burr, people who basically speak in jokes could write a good special about what happened to them yesterday. Its literally what they do. Dave is purposely choosing to write these jokes because theyre easy and theyll start shit. Its as simple as that.

When you guys come on here defending him you sound like those weird Eminem stans who INSIST that his new stuff is better than most rappers on the radio today and then you find out they dont even listen to any rappers other than Eminem. Youre lying to yourselves if you think sticks and stones wasnt miles away from something like the Bird Revelation. 

In closing, lets just agree to disagree at the very least. I still love Dave and Im sure he has great stuff left in him, well just probably never see it in a special. I dont hate him or anyone else because of the shit he says, Im just super disappointed that hes settled for making a TV dinner instead of his usual 5 course meal. Jokes like those are the fast food of comedy, and I would never have pegged him as the type of person to do something like this. Because I know hes better than that. And so do you.",0.21,0.074
"1140","Im a white transgender man. Ive always loved Dave Chapelle. My dad loved him, and I grew up watching his show and listening to Dave Chapelle in the background. Ive probably seen and heard almost everything hes said in front of a live audience.

Theres no denying that his jokes about trans people are shitty, and that hes a transphobe, no matter what he says or how much he denies it. But at the end of the day, he didnt really say anything thats deserving of having his special taken down. Were his jokes offensive? Too much? 100%. Were they hate speech? Spreading transphobia or misinformation? No.

Dave Chapelle has never said anything that a transphobe wouldnt already agree with. His jokes are offensive, but hes not radicalizing people into being transphobic or changing the minds of formerly non-transphobic people. Hes making fun of a minority he doesnt understand and never will, and catering to an audience of the same kind, but& isnt that comedy? Havent some of the most famous movies, and books done the same thing? Robin Williams and Eddie Murphy have made jokes at the expense of lgbt people, why havent they been cancelled? He also mocks white people, and asian people, and gay men. Why wasnt he cancelled for his jokes about asian people, in the midst of a rise in asian hate crimes? Hes not Ben Shapiro or JK Rowling, purposely and dedicatedly spreading misinformation and hate. Hes a comedian making asshole jokes.

And heres the thing. People all over are *rallying* to the cause of getting his special taken down. I saw the video of the guy getting his sign destroyed. Walk-outs, boycotts, social media campaigns and opinion pieces on major news websites like CNN. *Everyone* knows about it, *everyone* has an opinion on it, *everyone* thinks this and that for this well-researched reason and why.

**But how many of you know about the murder of Mel Groves? Royal Poetical Starz? Zoey Rose Martinez?**

Mel Groves was a 25 year old black trans man, who was killed on October 11th in Mississippi. He is the 39th confirmed violent death of a trans person in 2021. He was misgendered in the news coverage and in the police reports.

Royal Poetical Starz was a 26 year old black trans woman, who was killed on October 2nd in Florida. She is the 40th confirmed violent death of a trans person in 2021. She, too, was misgendered by police and the media.

And Zoella Zoey Rose Martinez was a 20 year old latina trans woman, who was killed on August 31st in Washington. After months of being misgendered and unrecognized as transgender by the police and the media, her family came out earlier this month to confirm her identity, and she is the 41st confirmed violent death of a trans person in 2021.

All of them were shot and killed. All of them were misgendered by both police and the media. All of them have gotten less attention than Dave fucking Chapelle and his shitty trans jokes.

I only discovered Mel Groves death from [a post his brother made](https://www.reddit.com/r/ftm/comments/q7sjx3/my_trans_brother_was_murdered_on_monday/) on r/ftm. If it wasnt for that post, I wouldnt know about Mels death at all.

Why are people putting so much energy into fighting about Dave Chapelle? Why are people boycotting Netflix? Why are people getting violent in public? Why are people outraged about his bad trans jokes, but not about the deaths of actual trans people?

We are dying. We are getting shot and being misgendered afterwards. Our deaths arent being looked into, arent being reported properly, arent being seen by anyone but other trans people, and all the greater world can focus on is a comedian. And the same goes for my fellow trans people. We numb out death and suffering and hate crimes, read about it and move on. But when someone makes a transphobic joke, we join the firestorm.

"1370","I think ""The Closer"" is disturbing. Why? Because, IMO, Dave Chapelle's transphobic 'comedy' killed Daphne Dorman. And he's trying to push the blame off himself and re-write history while paying off her family. Hear me out.

Dave, kind soul and trans ally that he is, supposedly 'helped' his friends career with a shoutout in Sticks and Stones. Right? Yeah, there are receipts. She was a part of HIS TRIBE, as he says. And that went great. For a short while. But how did that end up? With him 'joking' around, creating a massive controversy that ended up swirling around her trans identity and her career. She supposedly 'thrust herself' into the middle... but that's asanine. As if any comedian is just FREE of any pressure to defend an internationally famous Comedian and Movie Star like Dave Chappelle? He  talked about *her* in his special next to transphobic jokes. As if she wasn't damned no matter WHAT she said, she was going to be wrong and lose once Dave brought her into these comments publicly and directly. She was forced to choose between alienating one of her most famous career 'friends' or parts of her own community. And no matter what she had a target on her back by TERFs, the team Dave now proudly proclaims membership to. If I was put in that situation, I would be extremely distraught. But it's not as if she had the privelage of stay silent, as if Dave let her stay silent. Maybe she should have just hid and not said anything at all because being Dave's Trans Friend had big costs. But apparently that's not who she was. She didn't hide. Obviously she didnt want to alienate her 'friend' and famous colleague! Imagine if she had... imagine what her Twitter would have looked like if she dared condemn him? Imagine the hate messages she got from transphobes *regardless* of supporting Dave.

Back then and still today Dave's trying to use the 'my trans friend' defense. As if Dave doesn't know EXACTLY what he did or is doing because he's been the token minority friend before. Or maybe Dave's actually convinced himself she wasn't under any pressure to tell Dave exactly what he wanted to hear? No pressure to make the public statements defending him? OK. I don't believe it - he can't be that self unaware. Or maybe he is. Maybe he really see's himself as a some sort of multimillionaire regular Joe and Daphne being under no pressure in this situation. Maybe he believe Daphnes Twitter post so much that he really think they're on the same 'level'. Except for the fact he famously laughs and jokes about how rich and famous he is. And has for decades. Was Dorman rich and famous? Regardless, Dave *made* her choose by creating the situation and then defending 'his side' of the controversy. Invoking her existence to justify it all as if those offend just can't take a joke. No, he could have stopped this at any time with a press conference, by admiting his mistakes and taking criticism and learning. Or by just not making those 'jokes'... But his 'comedy' and 'art' were too important.

He talks like he was just a 'nobody' and that's bullshit. But! It's bullshit essential to the carefully crafted lie he tells himself and now the world. Because so long as he was just a 'nobody' back then (in 2019), so long as Daphne and him were 'on the same level', he doesn't have to see the true power relations that were at play - that he had so much more power and money and access and clout than 44-year old Dorman. That she was a hungry comedian. And that Daphne NOT defending him could risk her future and access to Dave and *his* powerful allies. Risk his audience attacking and hating HER.

In her suicide letter, she pleaded for us all not to blame anyone. Pleaded for me to NOT do what I'm doing now; for Dave to not blame anyone the way he just did in an international 'comedy' special. But if he gets to speak his 'truth' - his ego and guilt assuaging opinion about cancel culture then I get to speak mine. Dave Chappelle is paying money to her family to this day because he feels unresolved guilt - as well he should. But he's still making jokes that harm Trans people and cashing in - joking about beet juice coming out of 'fake pussys' like a middle schooler and insisting she'd have loved the joke. What. The. Fuck. She's dead Dave - what gives you the right? did the check you signed to her family give you the right to paint a smile on her mouth? Does anyone's friendship let them put controversial words in their dead friends mouth? To use their sucide as political point to help your career? Apparently money and a Netflix special and some rich friends will let you do a lot these days.

You know what I see in Dave? Someone who can't admit the wrongs he's done and is doubling down on them. It's pretty common, especially for folks with unresolved grief and guilt. He's not just making jokes. He's blaming the trans community for Dormans suicide, reiterating that it's a serious political issue, and then mocking the trans community, daring them to try to 'cancel him' again. He spent a good 1/4 to 1/2 of the special on it. And he almost HAS to.

Like... he isn't JUST transphobic - he has trans blood on his hand and he still needs to joke about it because admitting he was wrong is too hard. admitting he was responsible for what happened the last time he made these types of 'jokes' would mean admitting the only person who could of avoided the controvery, the only person who was truly in control of it from its inception... was him. He wants to... no he NEEDS to wipe his hands clean with guilt money payments and rewrite history. He needs to come out in his 'comedy' special and blame a nameless, faceless crowd who killed his 'friend'. Frankly, it may be the single whitest thing he's ever done. His rambling insults arent just backward, incomplete ways of atoning for the harm he caused - they are his only way of moving 'forward'.

Chapelle needs to blame the 'online mob' and thats convenient because then he gets to blame trans folk and trans allies for a dead trans woman. A perfect 'Win' for someone who hates trans folk. Because he needs to externalize his guilt and refuses to take responsibility for the 'jokes' that caused the controversy in the first place; for him creating the entire situation and letting it play out. And cashing in while laughing. Blaming 'cancel culture' is a convenient scape goat, one that also helpfully inoculates him from criticism. Which makes it all the more malicious; Dave knows exactly what he's doing and saying. And he well knows the costs.",0.183,0.143
"1372","But there's no other recourse at this point; the CEO thinks specials like 'The Closer' do no ""real world harm"". Netflix doesn't care about the lives, safety or well being of trans people - period. Worse the CEO thinks there's no harm in putting out specials that tell people they should be ""scared"" of the ""threat"" of trans women. Even as Netflix's own trans employees try to explain it to the CEO and walk out - they ignore them, silence them and put out statements saying they see no harm. And laugh and call it all a joke. I refuse to send money to such a company.

Daphne Dorman committed suicide after Sticks and Stones. *Because* of Dave Chappelle and his special... which created the entire controversy that swirled around her identity and career. And now, as a 'joke', Dave literally blames the LGBTQ community for bullying her to death in another Netflix special. But sure! That's a joke. Sure! These specials do ""no real world harm""... no harm to Cis people maybe. It's clearly a highly personal and political attack from where I stand.

No. The entire 'joke' and defense of it is carefully crafted transphobic propaganda - Dorman is dead because of Chappelle and his 'jokes' and the entire controversy CHAPELLE and NETFLIX created and made money on. Dave is proud of the guilt payments to her family, using them as proof of how he doesn't really hate trans people. How conveinent to toss some pocket change. He recognizes - at least on some level - he was responsible for creating the situation. But doesn't want to take REAL resposibility for it or change his behavior at all. Doesn't think he should have to. And now they're all laughing, saying it was joke that Daphne was in on, paying off the family and re-writing history as if this stuff doesn't do any harm. It's just evil.

Pretending trans folk have ""made all this progress"" as dozens of bills pass this year to make it harder for us to get healthcare, is also evil. Trying to place LGBTQ+ progress at Odds with Racial Justice? It's not funny - it's destructive AF.

This week, on National Coming Out Day, I watched from the closet as friends and even relatives defend Dave and paint trans people as violent, overly sensitive bigots who can't take a joke and bully our own into suicide... while laughing about how weird trans bodies are. Laughing and celebrating that we can't do anything about it because Dave is 'uncancelable'. As if he's taking power back from those evil ""transgenders""; as if being a trans woman gives me any special privelage =

I've watched people I thought were allies join in on the 'fun', ARGUE vehemently what he said wasn't transphobic at all. Meaning there are many folk who watch his specials and think, ""this is an acceptable way to talk and think about trans people."" And those people live in my hometown, went to school with me; some of those folk are BARELY convinced I should even be allowed to exist. a lot don't and think I'm a danger to children that should be stomped out. So no, I'm not laughing.

This isn't a real world harm ANYONE cares about but I decided against coming out this week. I don't want to walk outside or even be seen as myself RN; I'm afraid to say anything about Chappelle with my deadname and old profiles because I'll just paint a target for harassment and might be fully outted online and in RL. If the play is gonna be to mock trans women and construct us as irrational and dangerous threats and then argue such things do no real harm - then it's clear to me those spreading that narrative are *trying* to harm me. To shame me. To keep me in the closet forever, or else. Full stop. And they won this battle. So as long as the CEO of Netflix agrees with Chapelle that I'm the bigger threat here, I'll read books.",0.175,0.205
"1381","Hey folks. Here's a continuation on my post regarding the canceling Netflix dilemma. A common excuse often heard by naysayers is that people shouldn't be offended as Dave Chapelle is ""equal opportunity"" and attacks everyone, from Jews to blacks to gays, etc. How do you guys respond to it? Feel that it's still no excuse for his action and that's its as hateful to anyone as to trans people? Also, given how Netflix is going through a huge PR disaster thanks to his special and the co-CEO defending him, do you guys feel its reputation will be ruined as a hateful, anti-LGBT company, like Chick-fil-A or it'll recover?

I bet that employee thought they was Deep Throat. Both Deep Throats, probably. The fantasyland these people live in.

A fantasyland encouraged by the news. I would wager a supermajority of the public agrees with Chapelle, especially if they actually watched it and saw how heartfelt his plea was. I felt that it has the potential to be a ""Have you no decency?"" moment.

The only people in a furor are a tiny portion of the population who have managed to amplify their voices through--god, who knows?--guilt, a slippery slope, adolescents on twitter, a slow new days? To amplify them beyond any sense of decency or perspective. It's some fat virginal dudes LARPing in skirts, having discovered their only hope to get laid is to make up words and browbeat people with them, with their panties in a twist.

How has the monstrosity running ""Dear White People"" not been cancelled like St. Dolezal? Instead they keep mentioning its outrage, when what they should be doing is censuring it for making such a racist show.

I guess my real question is: are the people who don't give a flying fuck about all this doing themselves a disservice by not letting Netflix resoundingly know that they can't cave? I assume the viewership numbers are telling them just that, but perhaps a simple signature campaign or something like that to say to not just Netflix but the media in general, ""Most of us do not agree that the Chapelle special is in any way hateful or inciteful to violence (unless it's against white people, but that's another matter).""

I'm really getting sick of hearing about this shit. I'm getting older and I know the difference between real trans people--from friends I have had--and these faddists trying to pretend they're part of some great public moment of liberation because their lives in this failing empire have no other meaning.

The Kavernacle, a leftist youtuber, posted a video where he criticizes Dave Chappelle. Well, it's actually a long video where he criticizes woke capitalism and how companies publicly claim to support LGBT people while platforming anti-lgbt voices like Chappelle, Joe Rogan, and Steven Crowder. But most people in the comments focus on Dave.

The few positive comment threads are just circlejerking about how Crowder isn't funny. But most threads are collapsed and full of wordy arguments.

"4506","Im a white transgender man. Ive always loved Dave Chapelle. My dad loved him, and I grew up watching his show and listening to Dave Chapelle in the background. Ive probably seen and heard almost everything hes said in front of a live audience.

Theres no denying that his jokes about trans people are shitty, and that hes a transphobe, no matter what he says or how much he denies it. But at the end of the day, he didnt really say anything thats deserving of having his special taken down. Were his jokes offensive? Too much? 100%. Were they hate speech? Spreading transphobia or misinformation? No.

Dave Chapelle has never said anything that a transphobe wouldnt already agree with. His jokes are offensive, but hes not radicalizing people into being transphobic or changing the minds of formerly non-transphobic people. Hes making fun of a minority he doesnt understand and never will, and catering to an audience of the same kind, but& isnt that comedy? Havent some of the most famous movies, and books done the same thing? Robin Williams and Eddie Murphy have made jokes at the expense of lgbt people, why havent they been cancelled? He also mocks white people, and asian people, and gay men. Why wasnt he cancelled for his jokes about asian people, in the midst of a rise in asian hate crimes? Hes not Ben Shapiro or JK Rowling, purposely and dedicatedly spreading misinformation and hate. Hes a comedian making asshole jokes.

And heres the thing. People all over are *rallying* to the cause of getting his special taken down. I saw the video of the guy getting his sign destroyed. Walk-outs, boycotts, social media campaigns and opinion pieces on major news websites like CNN. *Everyone* knows about it, *everyone* has an opinion on it, *everyone* thinks this and that for this well-researched reason and why.

**But how many of you know about the murder of Mel Groves? Royal Poetical Starz? Zoey Rose Martinez?**

Mel Groves was a 25 year old black trans man, who was killed on October 11th in Mississippi. He is the 39th confirmed violent death of a trans person in 2021. He was misgendered in the news coverage and in the police reports.

Royal Poetical Starz was a 26 year old black trans woman, who was killed on October 2nd in Florida. She is the 40th confirmed violent death of a trans person in 2021. She, too, was misgendered by police and the media.

And Zoella Zoey Rose Martinez was a 20 year old latina trans woman, who was killed on August 31st in Washington. After months of being misgendered and unrecognized as transgender by the police and the media, her family came out earlier this month to confirm her identity, and she is the 41st confirmed violent death of a trans person in 2021.

All of them were shot and killed. All of them were misgendered by both police and the media. All of them have gotten less attention than Dave fucking Chapelle and his shitty trans jokes.

I only discovered Mel Groves death from a post his brother made on the ftm sub. If it wasnt for that post, I wouldnt know about Mels death at all. Then, a few days later, his brother made a post about how no one was paying attention to his brothers death- rightfully so. Someone crossposted it to the trans sub, and whats in the comments? A bunch of other white trans people getting mad at the crossposter. The same kind of people who want Dave Chapelles special taken down, getting pissed at someone else reminding them that a trans man is dead.

Dave Chapelle: Articles on CNN, CBS News, The Washington Post, Fox News, Reuters, etc. Pandemonium, strikes, social media movements and mass debates.

Mel Groves, Royal Poetical Starz, Zoey Rose Martinez: Articles on The Human Rights Campaign, The Advocate, PinkNews (all lgbt news sources), and a few posts on Reddit.

Why are people putting so much energy into fighting about Dave Chapelle? Why are people boycotting Netflix? Why are people getting violent in public? Why are people outraged about his bad trans jokes, but not about the deaths of actual trans people?

We are dying. We are getting shot and being misgendered afterwards. Our deaths arent being looked into, arent being reported properly, arent being seen by anyone but other trans people, and all the greater world can focus on is a comedian. And the same goes for my fellow trans people. We numb out death and suffering and hate crimes, read about it and move on. But when someone makes a transphobic joke, we join the firestorm. What kind of ethic is that?

And unless you knew about the death of Mel Groves, Royal Political Starz, and Zoey Rose Martinez, dont you dare say but he fuels the transphobia that killed them. Unless youre as **equally** outraged by the actual *murders* of trans people, youre a part of the problem, too.

"4620","Hi y'all, long time listener first time poster. I'm gonna try my best to suppress the urge to type a ten page diatribe against Dave Chapelle's violence and transphobia. Im gonna fail... sorry... there are far more insightful and elegantly written thoughts to read. But I just watched some of Vaush's commentary (Oct 17th YouTube Video) and felt like I needed to add a perspective I think most missed.

Vaush correctly says that Dave IS crass to use the suicide of his friend as a comedic or political point. But this misses the larger issue. Chappelle is saying that the LGBTQ+ community (or parts of it online) bullied Daphne Dorman to death. This is not what happened - not exactly. What did happen was Dave Chapelle created a controversy that swirled around the career and identity of a hungry, 44 year old trans woman stand up comedian after his special Sticks and Stones. 

Recall that Dave talked about her in his last special and that THEN she made the Twitter post in support of him, revealing who she was. Let's put ourselves in her shoes for a second. Dorman was in a situation where she had to choose between defending internationally famous movie star, comedian and career friend Dave Chappelle from a potentially costly controversy... or calling out his transphobia/staying silent and potentially alienating all his allys and connections and audience. And get dog piled by TERFs (likely happened even as she defended Dave, btw). Kind of an impossible situation. She was doomed to alienate a core community she relied on no matter what she did or said. And the result? she committed suicide.

Now, two years later, Dave desperately needs to rewrite history so that a nameless famous mob of queer people killed his 'friend' and that he's just telling harmless jokes. How can you just... ignore that? Like, the CEO of Netflix saying these specials do no harm is demonstrably false and is continuing actual violence.

Lets back up... maybe you think I'm crazy to suggest Daves words and actions (which he profited enormously from) led to Daphne's death. Well, Do you agree with him that the trans community bullied a trans woman to death (perfect transphobic propaganda btw)? Or do you agree with me that the only singular person who had the power to have avoided or stopped all this anytime before Dorman died was Dave. That Dorman was damned by Dave. I hope most rational, compassionate folk will agree with the latter.

And see... THAT'S the truly sick thing that happened in 'The Closer' and once you see it you can't NOT see it. much of his disjointed dialogue and anecdotes on trans issues make alot more sense when you see him as trying to paint Trans Woman and Trans Allies as irrational, dangerous and a literal threat. As him personally trying to avoid guilt and externalize blame he clearly still feels. Right after the 'Beyond Pussy' joke Chappelle suggested Dorman would have laughed with him on that one. That mad me angry. Maybe she would have but she's dead. And he's literally painting a smile on a dead trans woman face and pretending like she's in on the joke... really doesn't matter if the joke has 'Bones'. He's taunting us. He's painting this as if it's a 'cancel culture' issue and practically begging for more backlash, more trans woman to react. To prove him 'right'. This isn't comedy at all, Vaush. It's carefully placed all around actual comedy, but THIS isn't funny.

Please. understand that Dorman begged us all in her suicide note to NOT blame anyone. She just wanted it all to stop. Understand that I HATE blaming Dave for her death, but he just put out an international special that argues trans people online bullied her to death. that is EXACTLY what she didn't want Dave to do. He's not letting it stop... I feel like... I have to say something. It's clear Dave feels guilt on some level - he's paying for Daphne's childs schooling - but he won't change and is doubling down on the harm. Spinning these lies about the LGBTQ community to spare his ego and externalize that guilt. It's just... evil. 

He even misgenders Dorman at least once, while he claims her as a 'member of his tribe' - as if we are somehow at odds - but all he's done is protect and enrich himself off of Daphne Dorman. It all makes sense why he's screaming team TERF. He hates trans people. He's scared of us and scans for our presence. See's us as a threat. And to him it is not a joke. He literally says exactly this:

""Im gonna tell you right now, and this is true& these transgenders& the n×ggas want me dead. I got to tell you, Im very worried about it. Im not even joking with you. Every time I come out onstage, I be scared. I be lookin around the crowd, searching. For knuckles and Adams apples to see where the threats might be coming from. A n×gga came up to me on the street the other day. He said, 'Careful, Dave, they after you.' I said, 'What?' 'One they, or many theys?'""

If I am wrong or off base or completely skewed. Tell me. But I'm struggling to see this any other way RN. =",0.123,0.222
