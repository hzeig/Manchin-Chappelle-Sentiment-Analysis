&amp;#x200B;

 

While Democrats are working toward a slimmed-down framework for their social-spending bill, a priority many of them had from the start  significant investments in combating the climate crisis  looks like it might make the cut.

People familiar with the matter [told](https://www.axios.com/biden-spending-plan-500-billion-climate-167e44d7-3571-4a49-84dd-f70045449028.html?utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=editorial&amp;utm_content=politics-bidenclimate) Axios on Tuesday that the climate portion of Democrats' social-sending bill was ""mostly settled"" and would have a price tag of $500 billion to $555 billion, which isn't too far off from the $600 billion proposal Democrats first proposed under their initial $3.5 trillion package.

&amp;#x200B;

===============================================================

&amp;#x200B;

Biden will go to the United Nations climate summit in Glasgow tomorrow empty handed as the bill has not passed. 

Biben could have had the infrastructure bill passed and had a big win but the D's led by Pelosi tied the infrastructure bill with the social welfare bill.  They went double or nothing and they are at nothing.",0.054,0.035

*****
&gt; Sen. Joe Manchin on Thursday derided his own party&amp;#039;s plan to spend $3.5 trillion over the next decade to combat the climate crisis, invest in child care, and expand Medicare as &amp;quot;fiscal insanity.

&gt; Manchin has casually voted for nearly three times that for defense spending.

&gt; Last week, the House of Representatives passed the $770 billion military policy bill-which includes $740 billion for the Pentagon alone-by a vote of 316-113, with just 38 Democrats voting no.

&gt; In ongoing talks over the reconciliation package, Manchin is pushing for a top-line spending level of $1.5 trillion.

&gt; That figure is at least $2 trillion less over 10 years than Democrats&amp;#039; current plan, which would spend $3.5 trillion over the next decade.

&gt; As Win Without War executive director Stephen Miles noted Thursday, Manchin&amp;#039;s preferred $1.5 trillion number is &amp;quot;less than we&amp;#039;ll spend at the Pentagon over the next two years.

*****
&gt; Already under fire from progressive activists and lawmakers for holding up congressional Democrats and President Joe Biden&amp;#039;s agenda, Sen. Kyrsten Sinema drew additional ire Friday with reporting that she&amp;#039;s proposed cutting $100 billion in climate provisions from the reconciliation package.

&gt; &amp;quot;It is cruel and unfathomable that she&amp;#039;s demanding severe cuts to lifesaving climate legislation, but not surprising since she&amp;#039;s been meeting nonstop with corporate executives,&amp;quot; she said.

&gt; Democrats are expected to protect a proposed $150 billion clean electricity program as well as about $300 billion in tax incentives for wind and solar power and electric vehicles, the Times noted.

&gt; They may slash or scale back up to another $200 billion in other climate programs as part of an effort to win over Sinema and Manchin by reducing the package by $1.5 trillion.

&gt; Those could include a number of programs designed to help poor people adapt to the destructive impacts of climate change, as well as $30 billion for a &amp;quot;Green Bank&amp;quot; to help communities finance construction of solar panels and electric vehicle charging stations, and $30 billion to create a &amp;quot;Civilian Climate Corps&amp;quot; that would hire young adults to work in climate mitigation and adaptation, with half coming from communities of color.

&gt; Other potential cuts could include a $13 billion program to build new electric vehicle charging stations-including $1 billion to ensure that those stations are built in lower-income areas.

*****
&gt; Oct 27 - Democratic Senator Joe Manchin has leveraged his party&amp;#039;s slim majority in Congress to reshape President Joe Biden&amp;#039;s spending bill, slashing its initial price tag of $3.5 trillion and blocking policy proposals on climate and social programs.

&gt; Manchin hails from West Virginia, a heavily Republican, sparsely populated coal- and natural gas-producing state that sits at or near the bottom of U.S. health, education and infrastructure rankings.

&gt; The founder and partial owner of a private coal brokerage, Enersystems, Manchin has been reluctant to rein in fossil fuels, complicating Democratic efforts to combat climate change.

&gt; Manchin has signaled he opposes the measure, forcing Democrats to consider paring it down to four weeks or scrapping it altogether.

&gt; Asked on Tuesday whether he had concerns about the paid leave proposal, Manchin said: &amp;quot;I&amp;#039;m concerned about an awful lot of things.""

&gt; Manchin said on Tuesday that he thinks the proposal will not go through.

"15","The axiom in question is that every individual, and the individual alone, is responsible for their actions and the resulting outcomes. If you accept this axiom that means you accept the system that supports liberalism is never at fault, by default. However, because any critique of capitalism as a system necessarily requires criticism of the axiomatic assumptions capitalism makes, that means all critiques hold systems accountable. This is a dialectical conundrum. From the capitalist perspective the system can not be blamed for the individual actions taken within capitalism therefore capitalism can't be at fault when bad people do bad things, however socialism can be held accountable because it is a critique of the idea that the individual alone is responsible. Meanwhile from a socialist perspective material conditions and systemically incentivized actions are major points of discussion.

To put this another way; when Joe Manchin is both responsible for the climate change bill and holds stock in the fossil fuel industry the socialist would say Joe Manchin has as an outside influence that would cause him to perhaps write a subpar bill. The capitalist would put all the blame on Joe Manchin, and none on the system that allows him to have contradictory incentives. When a company like Nestle is found to be using literal slave labor, the capitalist would just say Nestle is doing a bad thing and leave it at that. The socialist would say that the profit motive incentivizes lowering the cost production and that you likely could not find labor cheaper than slavery, therefore the system incentivizes slave labor and both can be at fault.

Notice how one side has nuanced reasoning and wants to address systemic failures, while the other just shifts blame away from the system and onto the individual. Liberalism is slave mentality, cultish behavior, and requires an unearned trust in the system. Never has a liberal said anything worth considering in regards to politics, because they default to protecting the system at all costs. They are an irrational hivemind of credit ghouls.",0.096,0.105
"81","I try to tell my television and social media viewers about the world as it is, not what some might like it to be. 

The leadership of the whole world seems to be focused on a meeting in Glasgow, starting on October 31, 10 days away. 

25,000 delegates are expected to attend. They wont be going by boat or bicycle. They will travel first class in planes, belching carbon dioxide, to a conference about limiting carbon dioxide.

The police bill alone is estimated at $500 million. 

That is half a billion dollars.  

It could be said, accurately, that the conference is a failure before it begins. 

India have stated explicitly, this year, that coal will play a significant role in its ambition to become a $5 trillion economy. 

Thats according to Indias Home Minister, a powerful figure in Indias decision making process. In fact, India has acted to increase coal production, improve coal technology and modernise its coal plants. 

And more than 70% of all electricity consumed by Indias 1.3 billion people comes from coal.

India, at this point, have not committed to be there. 

What the hell are we doing heading off to Glasgow? 

And even then, despite an increase in coal production in India in order to supply power plants, as recently as August 28, there was a massive power supply shortage. 

As recently as late last month, the majority of Indias 135 coal plants had one weeks supply of coal. They are after high quality coal. Thats us, thermal coal.

But India also have a massive steel industry and they want high grade coal. 

Thats us, metallurgical coal. 

Which means one thing, Indias purchases of our coal and Russian coal will increase. 

As for coal fired power plants, China has approved, in the first half of this year alone, the construction of 43 new coal fired power plants.

Time Magazine said, China is leading the world in new coal power plants, building more than three times as much new coal power capacity as all other countries in the world combined in 2020.

The Guardian reported, Five Asian countries account for 80% of new coal power investment& China, India, Indonesia, Japan and Vietnam, said the Guardian, and China planned to build more than 600 coal powered units.

Yet were trotting off to Glasgow where the green chickens have already come home to roost. 

Several UK retail electricity providers have collapsed in recent weeks because of the surging price of gas. 

Only this week, Goto Energy joined the list of British firms to close down following the rise in gas prices.

Germanys electricity prices, the poster boy of renewables, oh yes, they work.

Energy experts say some German power suppliers are in danger of going insolvent; and because of Germanys heavy reliance on renewables, Germanys electricity prices have more than doubled since February. 

Skyrocketing power prices have caused UK steel makers to suspend production. 

A former energy advisor to the UK Government has warned that the countrys energy shortage this winter could prompt a three-day working week, which happened way back in 1974.

Anyone trotting off to Glasgow is a fool to rub shoulders with fools. 

Well, Boris Johnson is one of the hosts in Glasgow. So far, he has no plan to take with him to Glasgow. 

He presented to the British Parliament, earlier this week, several documents about net-zero strategies and net-zero reviews meant to offer some idea about how his whole agenda will work. 

To give you an idea about the mess Boris Johnson is in, one of the key steps for the UK to achieve its net-zero targets is changing how people heat their homes, moving them from gas boilers to the more environmentally friendly, heat pumps. 

Ease out gas boilers by 2035. 

But so unattractive is the project, homeowners will be offered 5000 pound subsidies to install the pumps when they replace their boilers. 5000 pounds! 

Now if that sounds crook, the price of a boiler can range from 6000 pounds to 15,000 pounds; critics say the current pot of money will only fund contributions to 90,000 new heat pumps in a country of 67 million. 

I am telling you, these people havent got a clue; they are just hoping.  

But here is the rub. 

No one has put a price on how much net-zero will cost. 

Are you ready for it? 

The British Governments Treasury has not put an overall price on the target but warns that tax rises could be required to balance out the erosion of tax revenue from fossil fuel related activity.

So there you are. 

Whether this all is approved in time for Boris Johnson to go to Glasgow, one thing he wont be able to take to Glasgow is what all this stuff will cost. 

How does the British worker relate to the news that tax rises might be required to balance out the erosion of tax revenue from fossil fuel related activity.

I will come to Australian workers in a moment. 

But, to America. Biden is going to take an entourage of hotshots, presumably for them to do the talk since he cant.

Former President Obama is going.

The only problem is, Biden too might finish up empty handed.

He wants his so-called climate legislation signed into law, but indications today are that he wont get it through the Senate.

Watch one name, Joe Manchin, a conservative Democrat from West Virginia, representing one of the countrys top coal producing regions, the equivalent of North Queensland and the Hunter Valley.

Senator Manchin knows West Virginians wont cop this attack on fossil fuels. 

But Biden needs all 50 Democrat Senators, including Manchin, to pass all legislation through Congress.

Manchin has reportedly said he will block the climate centerpiece in Bidens eye-watering US $3.5 trillion dollar piece of legislation.
 
Michael Mann, one of Americas most prominent climatologists has said on Twitter than Manchin had Just launched a hand grenade at Glasgow.

As I have said, this whole Glasgow charade could be over before it begins. 

Which brings me to Scott Morrison. 

Kevin Rudd went to Cop15 in Copenhagen in 2009. This stuff has been going on forever, we are at COP26. 

Rudd was COP15. 

Remember, Rudd was describing climate change as the greatest moral challenge facing humankind. He came home empty handed. 

Copenhagen, in 2009 was a failure. 

Tony Abbott then made mincemeat of Kevin Rudd. 

President Obama was the American President at the time and right to the death they were desperate to salvage something.

When it was all over, the UN, why would we go cap in hand to the UN on anything, the UN was picking up the pieces from a hopelessly divided, expensive and time wasting conference.

Kevin Rudd had to abandon his climate change legislation.

His credibility as a politician of conviction was almost entirely destroyed and Julia Gillard became Prime Minister six months later. 

Scott Morrison needs to be warned. 

If he goes to Glasgow with an un-costed program which threatens the fossil fuel industry, the source of our economic strength simply to rub shoulders with a stack of left-wing, green zealots, then the people who voted for Scott Morrison in 2019 when he opposed the very stuff this lot are going to Glasgow to endorse  then the Australian voter, the Australian worker, (remember, a lot of traditional Labor voters put Scott Morrison in the Lodge) these voters will say, Mr Morrison, we didnt vote for the Greens, we voted for what you argued about in 2019 - that a 45% reduction in carbon dioxide emissions, not 100%, Labors 45% was reckless, making a carbon tax, look like a mosquito bite.

And your Energy Minister, Angus Taylor, called it a wrecking ball 

Two years ago.

Prime Minister, I repeat, at the last election traditional Labor voters, blue collar workers, voted for you. 

Rubbing shoulders with this lot in Glasgow will lead them to say, simply, youve betrayed us. We need another leader. 

In the pubs they are already saying that they dont imagine a leader like Peter Dutton would countenance, let alone join the economic nonsense being proposed in Glasgow. 

One of the proposals unveiled by Boris Johnson yesterday was that the sale of gas and diesel cars would end by 2030 and car journeys in the cities would have to halve. 

Youd walk or cycle. 

Big Brother is alive and well. 

Scott Morrison, if you come home from Glasgow, and you shouldnt even be going, empty handed with any likely damage or cost to Australias economic wellbeing, then rest assured, the workers of Australia, your quiet Australians will find their voice. 

I have explained, earlier on in this piece, the attitude of China and India to fossil fuels. 

Prime Minister, you want to ignore that? 

The quiet Australian says, that doesnt make sense.

Kevin Rudd failed at Copenhagen. 

His fate may well await you. 

Rudd was replaced as leader. 

You may have to argue why you shouldnt be.",0.069,0.092
"96","The narrative around progressives being the ones to blame right now is absolutely insane. Here's why:

Biden has two bills he wants to pass:

* $1 Trillion in infrastructure
* $3.5 trillion for expanding healthcare, education, the child tax credit, and childcare.
* Both bills contain very mild measures to mitigate climate change.
* This spending is spread out over 10 years, or 450 Billion a year on average

Both bills are paid for by:

* Repurposing unused Covid stimulus funds
* ~~Mileage/road use taxes~~  Edit: Looks like this is not actually in the infrastructure bill, [just a study](https://apnews.com/article/fact-checking-907285011746)
* Raising the corporate tax rate from 21 to 26.5 or 28% (for context, it was 35 before the trump tax cuts)
* Raising the tax rate on the top tax bracket from 37 to 39%
* Effectively adding a new tax bracket of about 42% on income over $5 Million (""3% surcharge on incomes over $5M)
* Raising capital gains taxes
* There is some speculation as to whether this would cover the entire cost. If it doesn't though, we are talking about a 500-750 billion shortfall or 50-75 billion a year. Proponents say that economic growth would increase the estimated tax revenue enough to make this up.

Progressives (roughly 60 in the house and 11 in the senate, 26% of the party) wanted 6 trillion total, but said they would back both bills as-is providing both of them get passed. In fact, they have even said they are willing to go lower as long as conservative Dems provide a reasonable proposal.

All the Dems in between (150 in the house, 37 in the senate or 69.5%) are on-board with both bills.

Conservative Dems (Manchin, Sinema, and 10 house reps, or 4.5%) are the ones throwing a fit, even though their party's leader supports this bill. Their reasons are varied but they boil down to debt concerns (even though the bill is almost completely paid for), raising taxes (even though we're at one of the most unequal times in history and the tax increases are mostly just returning to pre-trump levels) and inflation (which is unlikely to accelerate given that the bills are paid for).

With the exception of Manchin and 1 of the house reps, none of these Dems have any reason to oppose the party's agenda since they all won their seats by 3 points or more in strong or leaning blue districts. You could maybe argue Sinema since Arizona is so split but her approval rating has tanked compared to her colleague Mark Kelly's.

To add to this, any alternatives seem to have been provided by house and senate leadership. Conservative Dems haven't provided any proposal other than ""I don't like it"". Manchin, who has the most reason to be a pain of any, is the only one to provide alternatives like reducing the number of years or means-testing.

I don't understand how CNN et al are treating centrists as some unmovable force of nature and progressives as the ones who are using their agency to derail these bills, when the centrists could just as easily back down and support the rest of the party that got them into power. 4.5% of the party is delaying the agenda of the other 95.5% and we're blaming the 26 % who is demanding we stick with it?

Edit: Both bills are extremely popular to boot. This is just one poll but still I think passing this will only help Dems, not hurt them.

#Child Tax Credit

Sen. Joe Manchin (D-WV) [reportedly](https://www.axios.com/scoop-manchins-red-lines-f9f5f7f7-56d8-4bf6-8345-13abb75ef03f.html) wants to impose an income cap and work requirement for the reconciliation bills child tax credit (CTC) in order to gain his support. A new [analysis](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/10/21/manchin-could-prevent-37-million-kids-from-getting-child-tax-credit.html) from the Niskanen Center, a moderate DC-based think-tank, found that Manchins $60k a year income cap would cut benefits from 37.4 million children, or 60% of the kids currently receiving the monthly payments.

&gt;In West Virginia, [170,000](https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2021/10/24/west-virginia-manchin-child-tax-credit/) children became newly eligible under the tax credit expansion, which was included in Bidens $1.9 trillion stimulus package passed in March. The changes to the tax credit raised the maximum benefit from $2,000 to $3,600 per child per year and dramatically expanded the share of poor families receiving the credit. In July, the food insecurity rate in West Virginia households with children dropped from 11.6 percent to 8.4 percent, and in September a survey found 86 percent of West Virginians felt the payments had made a huge difference.

* Manchins work requirement for child benefits would throw grandparent-led families under the bus, [WaPo](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2021/10/18/manchins-work-requirement-child-benefits-would-throw-grandparent-led-families-under-bus/).

#Climate change

A key provision in the reconciliation bill to fight climate change has been dropped due to the opposition of Sen. Joe Manchin...who just so happens to make millions from the fossil fuels industry. The Clean Electricity Performance Program (CEPP) would drive a transition to 100% clean electricity over the next 15 years by [rewarding](https://www.popsci.com/environment/clean-electricity-performance-program/) utilities that increase their share of clean electricity by 4% annually and charging a fee to those who dont.

Nearly all Senate Democrats appear to be on board with the program, supported by [66%](https://www.dataforprogress.org/blog/2021/9/30/voters-support-the-clean-electricity-performance-program) of voters, except for Manchin. According to his [spokesperson](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/15/climate/biden-clean-energy-manchin.html?partner=slack&amp;smid=sl-share), the Senator cant support using taxpayer dollars to pay private companies to do things theyre already doing. 

&gt;""The transition's already happening,"" Manchin told [CNN](https://edition.cnn.com/2021/10/19/politics/west-virginia-coal-rates-manchin-climate/index.html). ""So I'm not going to sit back and let anyone accelerate whatever the market's changes are doing.""

You may think he is simply advocating for his state, which is heavily reliant on coal, but West Virginians are paying a steep price:

&gt;The residential electricity rates of AEP's West Virginia subsidiaries have risen 122% over the last 13 years, from an average of $62.46 per month in 2008 to $138.57 per month in 2021& AEP's three coal-fired power plants in West Virginia -- John Amos, Mountaineer, and Mitchell -- are in need of $448 million worth of mandatory upgrades in order to remain federally compliant, causing electricity rates to increase by 3.3% starting in September 2022, according to Tammy Ridout, a spokesperson for AEP. These upgrades would allow the plants to stay open until 2040, rather than being shut down in 2028.

&gt;Kentucky and Virginia's public service commissions recently pulled their support from AEP's three West Virginia plants in need of upgrades, saying the plants are too expensive to support. But West Virginia's Public Service Commission recently ruled in favor of approving the upgrades to allow the plants to operate until 2040. ""The policy question here is whether it's appropriate for West Virginia ratepayers to pay more to keep uneconomical plants open,"" West Virginia House Delegate Evan Hansen told CNN. ""How many subsidies keep getting thrown at coal fired power plants to keep them open?""

The more likely explanation for Manchins stubborn resistance to clean energy is his bank account. Since he was elected to the Senate 11 years ago, Manchin has raked in over [$4.5 million](https://theintercept.com/2021/09/03/joe-manchin-coal-fossil-fuels-pollution/) from coal companies he founded. These firms have destroyed the local environment, sickened residents, and received numerous EPA and safety violations.

**Democrats are suggesting provisions to replace the CEPP but have not yet coalesced around a specific proposal.** One is keeping the incentive portion of the CEPP but getting rid of the fine for failing to switch over to clean electricity in the hopes of winning Manchins support. This approach risks losing progressive lawmakers, like Rep. Jared Huffman (D-CA):

&gt;Rep. Jared Huffman (D-Calif.), a member of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, [warned](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2021/10/21/key-senator-presented-an-alternative-power-plant-program-will-it-stick/) that any replacement to the CEPP must make significant progress toward President Bidens goal of reducing emissions at least 50 percent by 2030. You cant just throw money at any old thing and call it a deal, Huffman told The Climate 202 on Wednesday. So weve really got to replace it with something that provides comparable emission reductions in the power sector.

Another [alternative](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2021/10/16/white-house-climate-manchin/) under examination is a voluntary emissions trading system among aluminum, steel, concrete and chemicals manufacturers that would provide federal funding to help companies curb pollution. Its unclear how such a program would be structured. 

The White House is also exploring using different agencies to accomplish the same climate change goals:

&gt;A White House-backed clean power program that was rejected by Senator Joe Manchin could be resurrected as a grant program that would reward states that increase clean energy& The notion of using grants, which would require congressional funding through the spending bill being hashed out in Congress, dovetails with remarks made by Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm, who earlier this year said a national clean energy mandate could be done as a national contest between states if Congress doesnt go along with the plan&

&gt;There is a variety of discussions right now about how to have different authorities, different funding streams that can work in partnership with states, with utilities, with others in the private sector and local governments as well, [David Turk, the Energy Departments deputy secretary,] [told](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-10-20/state-grants-emerge-as-democrats-clean-power-plan-fallback?sref=Vi7wu7Hv) a Bloomberg Live event Tuesday.  There are a number of pathways here and those are the discussions we are having with key leaders on the Hill.

#Tax hike

The other roadblock in the Senate, Kyrsten Sinema (D-AZ) has taken issue with raising taxes to pay for the reconciliation bills social and climate programs. Democrats original plan included increasing the corporate tax rate and individual tax rate for high earners, partially undoing the 2017 GOP tax cuts under President Trump. Sinema reportedly opposes any tax hike, even on the super rich, despite voting against the GOP tax cuts. 

&gt;""She is committed to ensuring everyday families can get ahead and that we continue creating jobs,"" [Sinema spokesman John LaBombard [said](https://thehill.com/policy/finance/578102-sinemas-office-outlines-opposition-to-tax-rate-hikes)]. ""She has told her colleagues and the president that simply raising tax rates will not in any way address the challenge of tax avoidance or improve economic competitiveness.""

In order to pay for the bill and win Sinemas support, Democrats are working on alternative proposals like a targeted tax on billionaires:

&gt;Under the Billionaire Income Tax proposal, a summary of which was obtained by The [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/us-policy/2021/10/22/sinema-warren-billionaire-tax/), the federal government would require billionaires to pay taxes on the increased value of assets such as stocks on an annual basis, regardless of whether they sell those assets. Billionaires would also be able to take deductions for any annual loss in value of those assets.

&gt;The plan would also set up a system for taxing assets that are not easily tradable, such as real estate. The tax would apply to billionaires and people earning more than $100 million in income three years in a row.

Sinemas opposition to a broad tax increase on those making over $400,000 a year puts her at odds with most Americans: 68% support raising taxes on wealthy Americans and 62% say the same for raising the corporate tax rate, according to a Morning Consult [poll](https://morningconsult.com/2021/09/22/house-democrats-tax-plan-raising-taxes-wealthy-corporations-poll/).

#Drug pricing

Moderate House and Senate Democrats are also forcing their party to weaken their Medicare drug price negotiation plan, prompting some to despair that itd be better to drop the idea altogether:

&gt;Its been eviscerated, said Rep. Lloyd Doggett (D-Texas), who chairs the health subcommittee of House Ways and Means, and has pushed for aggressive drug price controls. At some point you have to ask: Is it worth it to pass it at all if its going to be some meaningless thing?

In its original form, the proposal would have given Medicare broad powers to bargain down the cost of hundreds of drugs, making them more affordable for all. The first sign of trouble came last month when three moderate Democrats on the House Energy and Commerce CommitteeReps. Scott Peters of California, Kathleen Rice of New York and Kurt Schrader of Oregon[joined](https://apnews.com/article/joe-biden-business-kamala-harris-kyrsten-sinema-joe-manchin-3f796484455ad3f36aea0da36ac3363a) with Republicans to drop the drug pricing language from a draft bill. 

Sen. Kyrsten Sinema has since joined the opposition group, according to unnamed sources cited by [Politico](https://www.politico.com/news/2021/09/19/kyrsten-sinema-biden-drug-pricing-prescription-plan-512907), despite [campaigning](https://www.accountable.us/news/report-sinema-abandoned-support-for-lowering-rx-drug-prices-after-flood-of-pharma-money-in-q3/) on lowering drug prices in 2018. 

&gt;During her 2018 Democratic primary campaign, Sinema [released](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/oct/11/big-pharma-has-a-powerful-new-shill-kyrsten-sinema-fighting-drug-price-reform) a direct-to-camera ad noting that her family had struggled with healthcare costs when she was younger. We need to make healthcare more affordable, with access to the lowest-cost prescriptions, and fix whats broken in the system, she said in the ad.

&gt;Sinemas 2018 campaign website featured similar language: Kyrsten is committed to making sure Arizonans have access to more health care choices, low-cost prescription drugs, and high-quality, dependable coverage. As one of the most independent-minded members of Congress, shes committed to working with anyone  regardless of party  to get it done.

The likely cause for her change of heart: a flood of money from pharmaceutical companies. During the 2019-2020 election cycle, Sinema [received](https://khn.org/news/a-senator-from-arizona-emerges-as-a-pharma-favorite/) nearly $100,000 from political action committees run by employees of drug companies and their trade groups.

&gt;That stands out in a Congress in which a third of the members got no pharma cash for the period and half of those who did got $10,000 or less. The contributions give companies a chance to cultivate Sinema as she restocks from a brutal 2018 election victory that cost nearly $25 million.

Her pharmaceutical haul since 2017 totals nearly [$400,000](https://www.opensecrets.org/members-of-congress/kyrsten-sinema/industries?cid=N00033983&amp;cycle=2022&amp;type=I).

&gt;The [slow progress](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2021/10/25/inside-phrma-fight-kill-democrats-drug-pricing-plan/) is in part due to an all-out lobbying campaign from the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, the drug industrys powerful trade group, to ensure nothing like the House proposal makes it into the reconciliation bill. PhRMA shelled out more than $22.4 million lobbying on drug pricing and other issues in the first nine months of the year, according to recent disclosure filings. And it has run TV ads warning the proposal will mean that politicians & decide which medicines you can and cant get.

&gt;...PhRMA appears mainly to have focused its efforts on lawmakers with concerns about House Democrats proposal. They include three House Democrats who opposed drug-pricing language in committee last month, and Sens. Tom Carper (D-Del.), Kyrsten Sinema (D-Ariz.) and Robert Menendez (D-N.J.).

#Other programs at risk

###Community College

Manchin has opposed a plan for tuition-free two-year community college education, saying he prefers making student loans forgivable. Let them earn it. Don't give it on the front end. Let them earn it on the back end, Manchin [said](https://rollcall.com/2021/06/16/proposed-education-spending-hike-faces-resistance-in-senate/).

Manchins position follows his stated belief that social spending leads to an entitlement society.

&gt;Im just not, so you know, I cannot accept our economy or basically our society moving toward an entitlement mentality. Im more of a rewarding, because I can help those who are going to need help if those who can help themselves do so.

A week later, he [criticized](https://news.yahoo.com/joe-manchin-says-bernie-sanders-022600466.html) Sen. Bernie Sanders (D-VT) approach to social spending: 

&gt;Ive been very clear when it comes to who we are as a society, who we are as a nation, Manchin said. I dont believe that we should turn our society into an entitlement society. I think we should still be a compassionate, rewarding society.

The tuition-free college plan has consequently been [dropped](https://www.cnn.com/2021/10/24/politics/pell-grant-free-community-college-biden/index.html) from the reconciliation bill.

###Paid leave

Manchin similarly is against the 12 weeks of paid leave, forcing Democrats to pare the time back to just four weeks or less. 

&gt;Asked Monday if he had concerns about the paid leave proposal, Manchin said: ""I'm concerned about an awful lot of things.""

Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY) is among those pushing Manchin to support more paid leave and was seen negotiating with him on Monday:

&gt;Im hoping to work with him on an employer, employee matching plan. Thats something hes very interested in and Im going to try to work with him on a plan that meets his area of interest, Gillibrand [told](https://twitter.com/mkraju/status/1452772779527483398?s=20) reporters&

###Medicare expansion

On Monday, Manchin told reporters that he opposes expanding Medicaid to cover hearing, dental, and vision care without first addressing insolvency ([clip](https://twitter.com/mkraju/status/1452692161707888643?s=20)):

""Medicare and Social Security is a lifeline for people back in West Virginia, most people around the country, and you've got to stabilize that first before you look at basically expansion. So, if we're not being fiscally responsible, that's really concerning...I've always said that I believe that government should be your best partner, but it shouldn't be your provider.""",0.133,0.057

&gt;It would help with child-raising expenses, from birth to college  
&gt;  
&gt;The megabill would have the federal government do far  more to support parents, providing money or establishing new programs  related to child care, pre-K, community college, and more.   
&gt;  
&gt;For all of these, the exact details about how they will  work remain to be determined and are subject to change, but Democrats  have indicated they would spend large sums of money on each of these  priorities:  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;**Paid leave**: Currently, the federal government does not guarantee paid leave for working parents. Some [states require it](https://www.kff.org/womens-health-policy/fact-sheet/paid-family-leave-and-sick-days-in-the-u-s/), and some employers voluntarily offer it  but [small businesses](https://www.kff.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/8949-05-Figure-3.png) and [employers with few high-wage workers](https://www.kff.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/8949-05-Figure-4.png)  are less likely to do so. So the megabill would create a national paid  leave program, in which the government would pay part of a workers  salary for up to 12 weeks of leave (for new parents or other issues,  such as serious illness). As [Matt Yglesias wrote earlier this year](https://www.slowboring.com/p/families-plan#footnote-anchor-2),  under Bidens plan the governments share of these leave payments would  be capped at $4,000 a month, so in practice, this would be most useful  for low-wage workers.   
&gt;  
&gt;**Child care subsidies**: The bill would also try to help  low- and middle-income families with the cost of child care. Basically,  if you earn below a certain amount, the federal government would help  foot the bill for your child care  subsidizing it so that costs wont  exceed a certain percentage of your income. Many details remain to be  worked out here, particularly Bidens [promise](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/04/28/fact-sheet-the-american-families-plan/) that the resulting child care will be high quality, which seems more challenging to implement.  
&gt;  
&gt;**Funding pre-K**: In much of the US, public schooling  starts at age 5, with kindergarten, and many parents of 3- and  4-year-olds dont have a government-funded option for pre-K. The bill  would try to change this, allotting [hundreds of millions of dollars](https://www.politico.com/newsletters/weekly-education/2021/08/02/senate-mulls-a-path-to-universal-pre-k-796857) for preschool expansion. This implementation would again have to happen at the state and local levels.  
&gt;  
&gt;**Summer lunches for low-income children**: Currently,  low-income children can get free lunch at school, and Democrats want to  extend that benefit to cover the summer when school is out  another  anti-poverty measure.  
&gt;  
&gt;**Free community college**: The bill would fund [Bidens plan](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/07/22/what-bidens-free-community-college-plan-would-cost-and-save-americans.html) to cover two years of free community college to those who want it.  
&gt;  
&gt;**Expanded Pell grants**: Low-income students who rely on Pell grants to help pay for college would get extra help under this bill.  
&gt;  
&gt;Its a health care bill, especially for seniors  
&gt;  
&gt;Even after Obamacare extended health insurance to  millions more Americans, major gaps in the USs system and the benefits  it provides remain  gaps that frequently expose Americans to burdensome  and even ruinous expenses. This years megabill is expected to fill  several of those gaps:  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;**Medicare expansion to cover dental, vision, and hearing**:  The megabill would expand Medicare to cover dental, vision, and hearing  benefits (which are mostly or entirely not covered in standard Medicare  plans), meaning it could be a huge help to [seniors who incur those expenses](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/09/business/medicare-dental-work-bill.html). The budget resolution also would allow for [lowering the eligibility age](https://www.axios.com/dems-medicare-expansion-infrastructure-sanders-5a085562-efbc-4f7d-8747-dc77ef6c0ec2.html) for Medicare, but it is unclear at this point whether this will make it into the eventual bill.  
&gt;  
&gt;**Medicare drug price negotiation**: Democrats also plan to empower Medicare to negotiate with the federal government on [prescription drug pricing](https://www.wsj.com/articles/democrats-split-over-measures-to-cut-drug-prices-11625662801),  something that would drive prices down for seniors. It has the added  benefit of driving costs down for the federal government, which would  help pay for the megabills new spending.  
&gt;  
&gt;**Long-term care**: Democrats also hope to spend hundreds  of billions of dollars on long-term care for seniors and people with  disabilities who need daily assistance. As [Jonathan Cohn writes](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/home-care-elderly-disabilities-dingell_n_60f4381ae4b01ba8eed71236), more than 800,000 Americans are on waiting lists for home and community-based care services right now, due to lack of funding.  
&gt;  
&gt;**Medicaid expansion**: There are still [12 states](https://www.kff.org/medicaid/issue-brief/status-of-state-medicaid-expansion-decisions-interactive-map/) that have not implemented Obamacares [expansion of Medicaid](https://www.vox.com/2015/1/27/18088994/medicaid-expansion-explained) to more low-income people, and Democrats have committed to ensuring they get coverage in this bill  though theyre [still debating](https://www.politico.com/news/2021/07/10/obamacare-medicaid-coverage-gap-democrats-499013) how, exactly, to do it.  
&gt;  
&gt;**Affordable Care Act subsidies**: Finally, Democrats also [intend to make](https://www.kff.org/health-reform/issue-brief/how-the-american-rescue-plan-act-affects-subsidies-for-marketplace-shoppers-and-people-who-are-uninsured/)  temporary, pandemic-inspired expansions in subsidies for people getting  health care on Obamacares individual marketplaces permanent.  
&gt;  
&gt;Its a climate, housing, and immigration bill  for now, at least  
&gt;  
&gt;Democrats are also using this bill as the vehicle for  their climate change agenda. The catch is that the bill will have to win  the approval of coal-state Sen. Joe Manchin, so dont expect a frontal  assault on fossil fuels. But Democrats remain hopeful that measures to  support clean energy can win Manchin over.   
&gt;  
&gt;Current plans are to include:  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;**A clean electricity payment program**: The marquee  climate policy in this bill would be a call for 80 percent of the USs  electricity to be generated by clean sources by 2030, [according to E&amp;E News](https://www.eenews.net/articles/manchin-could-get-top-role-in-writing-clean-energy-standard/).  The bill likely cant directly mandate this due to restrictions in the  reconciliation process. But it will try to achieve it by [making payments](https://www.eenews.net/articles/payments-or-fines-how-dems-ces-would-affect-utilities/) to utilities that rely on clean energy, while fining those that arent making progress toward reducing carbon emissions, as [my colleague Rebecca Leber recently explained](https://www.vox.com/22579218/clean-energy-standard-electricity-infrastructure-democrats). Manchin will play a big role in crafting this, as he chairs the key Senate committee that will be involved.  
&gt;  
&gt;**Clean energy tax incentives and research money**: Renewable energy industries like wind and solar would get [big tax breaks](https://www.wsj.com/articles/democrats-budget-would-finance-sweeping-clean-energy-plan-11626620401), and a clean energy accelerator [would be funded](https://www.axios.com/climate-provisions-senate-democrats-budget-proposal-016cce3b-9fb9-48c2-bf3e-73822484f8c0.html) to support new technologies.   
&gt;  
&gt;**Polluter import fee and methane polluter fee**: The idea for an outright carbon tax is [long dead](https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2021/07/obituary-carbon-tax-beloved-climate-policy-dies-47/619507/), but Democrats have [proposed](https://www.rollcall.com/2021/07/15/in-reconciliation-democrats-eye-border-tax-for-carbon/)  putting tariffs on imported goods from countries with weaker  restrictions on carbon emissions, and putting a price on methane  emissions (which [heavily contribute](https://www.edf.org/climate/methane-crucial-opportunity-climate-fight) to climate change).  
&gt;  
&gt;Other issues the bill may tackle:  
&gt;  
&gt;**Housing:** Democrats plan to allot  hundreds of billions of dollars more for affordable housing, with money  going to rental assistance and homeownership initiatives, as well as the  creation and preservation of affordable housing.  
&gt;  
&gt;**Immigration**: Finally, though details  remain scarce, Democrats are currently saying they intend to include in  the megabill a path to legal status for some undocumented immigrants.  Sen. Bob Menendez (D-NJ) [told NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/immigration/democrats-pursue-ambitious-immigration-changes-3-5-trillion-budget-measure-n1274095) last month this would apply to some of each of the following categories: those [who came here as children](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/8/31/16226934/daca-trump-dreamers-immigration), farmworkers, people with [Temporary Protected Status](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2021/3/8/22319875/venezuela-tps-temporary-protected-status-biden), and essential workers. 

Mods, I realize this post may be pushing the limit, but this bill is expected to be the largest expansion to the American social welfare since LBJ's Great Society.

Men are over-represented amongst the poorest in society, and key provisions like subsidized housing, and paid paternity leave could dramatically improve male welfare.",0.23,0.041

*Community college, clean electricity program could be dropped, while other programs may be slimmed down*

By [**Andrew Duehren**](https://www.wsj.com/news/author/andrew-duehren), [**Andrew Restuccia**](https://www.wsj.com/news/author/andrew-restuccia), and [**Kristina Peterson**](https://www.wsj.com/news/author/kristina-peterson)

WASHINGTON  Democrats accelerated efforts to strike a deal on their [social-policy and climate legislation](https://archive.md/o/CJDRm/https://www.wsj.com/articles/democrats-budget-plan-what-11626301275?mod=article_inline), as President Biden identified programs that party lawmakers could eliminate or slim down during a flurry of meetings at the White House Tuesday.

Mr. Biden said that [two years of tuition-free community college](https://archive.md/o/CJDRm/https://www.wsj.com/articles/bidens-plan-for-free-community-college-faces-resistance-11621170004?mod=article_inline) likely wont be in the bill, according to several attendees and people familiar with the meetings. He also acknowledged that opposition from Sen. Joe Manchin (D., W.Va.) to a clean electricity program would require Democrats to abandon it, according to lawmakers at the meetings.

Those two provisions are just a part of the wide-ranging social-policy and climate bill [Democrats are attempting to craft](https://archive.md/o/CJDRm/https://www.wsj.com/articles/democrats-face-a-deadline-on-safety-net-and-climate-bill-consensus-11634468400?mod=article_inline) in the next few weeks. Initially set to cost $3.5 trillion, Mr. Biden is now trying to rally the progressive and moderate wings of the party around a new framework with a price tag of around $2 trillion. Some lawmakers said they were optimistic Democrats could reach a deal by the end of the week. After the meetings concluded White House press secretary Jen Psaki said there was broad agreement that there is urgency in moving forward over the next several days and that the window for finalizing a package is closing.

Mr. Biden met with both a group of progressive House Democrats and moderate Democrats. He also held two individual meetings with Sens. Kyrsten Sinema (D., Ariz.) and Mr. Manchin, pivotal centrists in the 50-50 Senate.

Democrats have differed over [how to trim the size of the package](https://archive.md/o/CJDRm/https://www.wsj.com/articles/democrats-weigh-cutting-programs-or-reducing-scope-to-trim-3-5-trillion-bill-11633273309?mod=article_inline), with progressives pushing for the party to reduce the duration of many of the bills different programs and preserve them all, even if just for a short duration. Centrists and top House Democrats have favored focusing resources on a smaller number of programs for the long term.

Democrats said that Mr. Biden endorsed the progressive approach during the meetings on Tuesday.

I think he is with us that we need to invest in as many of those transformational areas as possible, even if it means for some of them a shorter amount of time, Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D., Wash), the chairwoman of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, said. 

I favor the other approach, I think we should have few programs that we do well but the reality is weve got a math problem, said Rep. Mike Thompson (D., Calif.), who attended the meeting with moderate Democrats. I think shorter duration is whats going to be.

Mr. Biden indicated to Democrats that the [compromise would include universal prekindergarten](https://archive.md/o/CJDRm/https://www.wsj.com/articles/bidens-pre-k-proposal-faces-questions-over-federal-role-11625572800?mod=article_inline), according to several people familiar with the discussion, though the funding for other programs could be cut. Democrats have discussed reducing the number of weeks covered under a proposed federal paid-leave program, which would offer 12 weeks of leave as currently drafted. 

Mr. Biden said that the White House would base any possible income cutoffs for eligibility for new programs on median state incomes, according to Mr. Thompson. 

More broadly, some lawmakers said Mr. Biden implied that the bills total spending wasnt likely to top $1.9 trillion, on the low end of the range that he had previously floated to them. But others left with the impression that the programs under discussion were still in the $1.9 trillion to $2.2 trillion range, according to lawmakers and aides.

On Capitol Hill, where top progressives and centrists have met in recent days, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D., N.Y.) said that Democrats would aim to reach an agreement on the contours of the legislation by the end of the week. White House officials and some Democrats on Capitol Hill said they were becoming more optimistic that the party could soon unify behind a proposal.

Overall, almost every priority is included, Rep. Ro Khanna (D., Calif.) said of the package discussed at Tuesdays White House meeting. 

Mr. Manchin said a deal by the end of the week was possible. 

Democrats are racing to make progress on the social policy and climate bill by the end of the month, when House Democrats are hoping to pass a separate, roughly $1 trillion infrastructure bill. Progressives have insisted on moving the two pieces of legislation together, making an agreement on the social-policy and climate bill a [politically necessary precondition of passing](https://archive.md/o/CJDRm/https://www.wsj.com/articles/democrats-try-again-to-pass-infrastructure-bill-11633097276?mod=article_inline) the public works bill.

At the same time, Mr. Bidens senior advisers hope the president can arrive at a [pivotal international climate-change meeting](https://archive.md/o/CJDRm/https://www.wsj.com/articles/glasgow-climate-summit-faces-high-risk-of-failure-u-n-leader-says-11632166025?mod=article_inline) in Glasgow that begins on Oct. 31 having made progress in the congressional negotiations. The president stressed to Democrats on Tuesday that he would like to see significant progress on the package before the Glasgow summit, arguing that the international meeting offered the U.S. an opportunity to show the world that Washington isnt hopelessly dysfunctional.

The president was pretty clear that hed like to have this hammered out before he goes off to Scotland, said Rep. Ami Bera (D., Calif.), who attended the meeting of more centrist Democrats.

Much of the negotiation has focused on earning the support of Mr. Manchin, who has said he supports $1.5 trillion in spending. His opposition to a central climate-change-related provision in the package has [prompted lawmakers to reconsider](https://archive.md/o/CJDRm/https://www.wsj.com/articles/democrats-lean-toward-dropping-clean-electricity-plan-from-budget-package-11634353044?mod=article_inline) the bills climate efforts. 

Democrats had designed the clean-electricity performance program to provide grants to utilities that increase the amount of clean electricity they generate by at least 4% a year, while penalizing utilities that dont meet that standard. Mr. Manchin has argued that utilities shouldnt receive federal funds for an energy transition they are already making.

Rep. Jared Huffman (D., Calif.), who attended Mr. Bidens meeting with progressives, said he was concerned that Democrats would fall short of Mr. Bidens emissions-reduction goals without the clean energy program. Mr. Biden indicated he was looking at alternatives, he said.

The president said he stands by that goal for emissions reductions and would continue the conversation at a higher level of detail, Mr. Huffman said. 

Among those alternatives are a tax on carbon emissions. But some key Democrats expressed skepticism about a carbon tax, making adoption of the proposal unlikely. I dont see how it works and is equitable, Sen. Jon Tester (D., Mont.) said, taking issue with a proposal to reimburse the tax back to the public at a flat rate. The carbon tax isnt on the board at all right now, said Mr. Manchin.

Some Democrats are discussing polluter fees; others want Mr. Biden to declare a climate emergency and unilaterally establish policies to cut carbon emissions.

Democrats are using a process called budget reconciliation to try to pass the bill with just a simple majority, rather than the 60 votes usually required to advance legislation in the 50-50 Senate. Because Republicans have lined up against the bill, calling it wasteful and a threat to the economy, Democrats will need the support of every member in the Senate. 

Mr. Manchin met on Monday individually with Sen. Bernie Sanders (I., Vt.) and Ms. Jayapal, two influential progressive lawmakers.",0.092,0.04

By [**Paul Krugman**](https://archive.md/o/2FGE5/https://www.nytimes.com/by/paul-krugman) | *October 21, 2021*

Im not one of those liberals who believe that corporate greed is the root of all evil. Its the root of only some evil; there are other dark forces, especially white nationalism, stalking the U.S. body politic.

But corporate money is surely the villain behind the latest roadblock to President Bidens agenda: Senator Kyrsten Sinemas [opposition](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/20/us/politics/democrats-tax-rates.html) to any rollback to Donald Trumps big 2017 corporate tax cut.

After all, Sinema, who was in the House of Representatives at the time, voted [against](https://clerk.house.gov/Votes/2017699) that tax cut. And she [attacked](https://www.dailyposter.com/kyrsten-sinemas-tax-flip/) the tax cut the next year during her run for the Senate. Given that raising taxes on corporations has [overwhelming public support](https://www.vox.com/2021/10/15/22723457/build-back-better-poll-democrats-bill-infrastructure-taxes), its hard to see any reason for her flip other than the corporate [lobbying blitz](https://www.washingtonpost.com/us-policy/2021/08/31/business-lobbying-democrats-reconciliation/) against Build Back Better.

Its a distressing story. But heres what you need to know: While the Trump tax cut was bad and should be reversed, reclaiming the lost revenue isnt essential right now. If the key elements of the Biden agenda  investing in children and in protecting the planet against climate change  have to be paid for in part by borrowing, thats OK. It would certainly be better than not making those investments at all.

About that tax cut: The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act was [sold](https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/20210628_TPC_GaleHaldeman_TCJASupplySideEffectsReport_FINAL.pdf#page=3) with claims that a lower corporate tax rate would induce U.S. businesses to bring back money they had invested overseas, leading to a surge in business investment that would increase productivity and wages. This was a slightly more plausible story than the usual justification for tax cuts, the claim that they will give already rich people an incentive to work harder. But none of it happened.

On paper the tax cut act did seem, briefly, to cause a [repatriation of money](https://twitter.com/paulkrugman/status/1451137494238605315) to the United States. For a few quarters after the tax cut, U.S.-based multinationals reported that their overseas subsidiaries were disinvesting and sending their profits home via increased dividends paid to their parent companies. But this was a temporary blip, not a sustained change in behavior.

And theres no indication that the tax cut led to any increase in [business investment](https://blogs.imf.org/2019/08/08/us-business-investment-rising-market-power-mutes-tax-cut-impact/) here beyond what you would have expected given the economic situation.

The most plausible interpretation of the data is that cutting corporate taxes basically had no economic effect at all. While U.S. businesses report having invested large sums overseas, a lot of that is [phantom](https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/fandd/2019/09/the-rise-of-phantom-FDI-in-tax-havens-damgaard.htm) investment, an accounting fiction perpetrated to shift reported profits to low-tax jurisdictions like Ireland. A lower U.S. tax rate reduced the incentive to sustain this fiction, so some money was shifted back onto parent-company books. But nothing real actually happened.

So the Trump tax cut was just the latest in a long series of giveaways to the wealthy that were sold on false pretenses. And Sinema should be ashamed of herself for helping corporate interests perpetuate this grift.

That said, the Biden agenda doesnt need the revenue from a higher corporate tax rate.

The budget resolution that will make it possible to move forward on that agenda if Sinema and Senator Joe Manchin can be brought on board doesnt require that all investments in the future be fully paid for. In fact, it allows for up to [$1.75 trillion](https://www.crfb.org/blogs/senate-budget-resolution-would-allow-175-trillion-borrowing) in borrowing. And if opposition from the corporate wing of the Democratic Party  can we stop calling them moderates?  prevents tax increases, better to borrow than not to invest.

Should we be worried that increased borrowing would threaten U.S. solvency? No. The interest rate on long-term federal debt is only about [1.65 percent](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/DGS10), so even adding $1.75 trillion in debt would mean only about $30 billion added to annual interest costs  0.15 percent of [gross domestic produc](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/GDP)t, which is trivial.

And even this calculation greatly overstates the true debt burden, which should be calculated using the real, that is, inflation-adjusted, interest rate  which is [negative](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/DFII10).

What about concerns that deficit-financed spending might be [inflationary](https://www.wsj.com/articles/manchin-pelosi-biden-3-5-trillion-reconciliation-government-spending-debt-deficit-inflation-11630605657)? Again, its important to do the math. If the U.S. were to end up borrowing another $1.75 trillion, that would be over the course of a decade, not a single year  and the Congressional Budget Office projects total G.D.P. over the next decade of [$288 trillion](https://www.cbo.gov/system/files/2021-07/57218-Outlook.pdf#page=2). So while it might sound as if were talking about huge deficit spending, the additional deficit would be only 0.6 percent of G.D.P., which simply isnt a big deal.

In fact, given the arithmetic you might wonder why Biden ever wanted to raise taxes enough to fully pay for his investment agenda. The answer, I think, was more about the politics than the economics  that pitching his plans as deficit-neutral was supposed to reassure politicians who havent caught up with [current mainstream economic thinking](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/19/upshot/deficit-public-debt-debate.html), and who still regard budget deficits as a major threat.

At this point, however, it looks as if a final budget deal, if there is one, will have to involve substantial borrowing. And thats OK. We can deplore the corporate influence that may block some justified tax increases, but borrowing to invest for the future isnt a bad thing in itself. Hey, businesses do it all the time. So Democrats should just go for it.",0.1,0.125
"1200","Joe Manchin's 1.5T resolution bill proposal is the first specific bid from the conservative wing outlining what kind of resolution bill they (or at least Manchin personally) would be willing to pass. It's sure to upset progressives, who were pushing for something much larger and more comprehensive. However, with only 50 votes in the senate, any bill will have to be approved by Manchin in order to pass.

I recommend this jacobin article talking about the media coverage of the what is going on in the senate. Progressives are pushing for big social spending bill, and whilst most democrats have agreed to it, there are two especially corrupt moderates holding it back.

To even call them moderates when they are so blatantly corrupt is a national tragedy. Kyrsten Sinema is literally teaching a college course on [fundraising](https://theintercept.com/2021/10/08/kyrsten-sinema-fundraising-course-asu/). Joe manchin himself owns massive amounts of [shares in coal companies](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.businessinsider.com/senator-joe-manchin-half-million-year-coal-stocks-climate-crisis-2021-9%3famp). Whilst these details arent exactly secrets, Bernies conflicts with these two are rarely ever presented as what it is. Instead this is a personal ideological conflict and both sides should meet in the middle. Joe manchin isnt called out on tv every appearance, and kyrsten sinema doesnt get exposs on her financial dealings on tv. 

This is a perfect study on the neoliberal bias of the news networks. When Bernie called this abysmal coverage out he is scolding for it in CNN. In a more perfect world the media would be asking Biden why he hasnt already given the two remaining senators a whopping.",0.073,0.053

"3561","American Tribalism: How the Fringes Control Our Democracy
Domestic divisions are the greatest threat to our national security.
-Susan Rice.

Identity with a political tribe has taken supreme precedence over matters such as ideology. Blind allegiance is rewarded, not independence, thoughtful consideration, or compromise. Dissent has lost much of its political prestige, the respect, if begrudging, for those profiles in courage has largely evaporated. Courageous senators of a time not long past were once applauded for their courage, if not their action (Wayne Morse on the Gulf of Tonkin, James Buckley on Watergate, Charles Goodell on Vietnam, or Howard Baker on the Panama Canal)a When we do see courageous political dissent (e.g from John McCain on the Affordable Care Act or Joe Manchin on the nomination of Justice Kavanaugh), its emissaries are greeted with only contempt. The descent of politics into a conflict between groups held in near religious reverence by their followers is antithetical to democracy itself and seems to absolve its participants from the basic rigors of civility. Civil disagreement is trumped by a hatred reminiscent of that between Protestants and Catholics in Northern Ireland. From Jesse Helms, Newt Gingrich, or the Tea Party on the right to Bernie Sanders, Alexandria Ocasio Cortez, and the Justice Democrats of the left, polarization has grown steadily worse.
These partisan tribes develop norms that are then used as the standards for partisan to be conforming group members. As people identify with a group more strongly, they conform to these tribal norms to appear as good members of their tribe, and those who do not conform to the tribal norms are targeted by the extremists within the tribe through systems such as primaries. For instance, Republican Representative Bob Inglis of South Carolina lost a 2010 primary to Trey Gowdy by 40 points despite having a 93% rating from the American Conservative Union due to Ingliss support of climate legislation, a post recession bailout, and his opposition to the 2007 troop surge in Iraq. Even dissent as minor as Representative Ingliss can trigger a tribal reaction from the group. Georgia Senator Kelly Loeffler campaigns extensively on her voting record of siding with President Trump on 100% of votes, in my view it is a sad reflection on the state of our political process if an absolute lack of dissent is applauded by ones supporters. 
In 2016 researchers assembled 1,178 Washingtonians for a study on how partisanship affected their perception of a ballot measure that would institute a carbon tax. The group was divided evenly between Republicans and Democrats; those groups were further divided into a groups viewing Republican endorsements of the policy and Democratic opposition, and a group viewing Republican opposers to the policy and Democratic endorsers. While Republicans continually opposed the policy, they were much more prone to supporting it when told that famous Republicans such as George Shultz (An advisor to the Eisenhower Administration, Nixons Secretary of Labor and the Treasury, and finally Reagans Secretary of State) had endorsed the policy. This gap was only more pronounced among the well educated in these groups. Global warming is an existential threat to humanity itself, yet our views on it are largely informed due to partisan biases as opposed to scientific fact. 
The Medias Role:
The Soviet Unions propaganda newspaper was entitled Pravda, Russian for truth, so too does Fox News motto of Fair and Balanced disguise propaganda and an impartiality taken seriously by few. Politics is not a sport, to create policy and build a united nation compromise is second only to the understanding of others beliefs. Media-be it from the right or left-portrays political happenings as a conflict between two teams, with a win being valued over the nations wellbeing, and, as the saying goes, perception often becomes reality. The facile portrayal of politics as a sport in news has led political discourse to increasingly adopt these characteristics. Media gains views through sensationalism and the portrayal of politics as a horse race, but in doing so it preys on our divisions and often provides a platform to those such as climate change deniers or other conspiracy theorists who normally would be shut from the arena of mainstream political belief. As Carlton University professor Jim Davies explains, everything about the newsfrom the dramatic headlines to the riveting background music to the colors on the screen (lots of red, which experts agree is one of, if not the most, emotionally charged color)is engineered to prey on our hardwired impulses to pay attention to what seems exciting and important. The manner in which the news is presentedbe it on television or the social feeds on our phoneoften triggers the release of dopamine, a powerful neurochemical that tags experiences as meaningful and makes us want to seek them over and over again. 
The national motto of the United States is E Pluribus Unum or Out of Many, One. Humans are naturally tribal creatures, but our founders understood that democracy requires us to embrace pluralism and unite our many tribes into one united nation. Social media is in diametric opposition to these principles, sorting us into tribal echo chambers by way of clandestine algorithms that dehumanize our opposition and do no more than confirm our biases. Social media has also opened the door to foreign interference in our elections and the inflammation of our tribal instincts by way of Russian, Chinese, or Iranian propaganda. Foreign disinformation now colors our view of our fellow Americans and of our democratic processes themselves. Anti-democratic actors such as Father Coughlinb harnessed the new technology of radio to fan the flames of fascism, but today we are faced with thousands of Fathers Coughlin spreading disinformation not in weekly radio broadcasts, but in a never-ending firehose of social media extremism that pushes our society deeper into division. Tom Wheeler of the Brookings Institution put it well; digital technology is gnawing at the core of democracy by dividing us into tribes and devaluing truth. 
The Importance of Interaction:
I would argue that the best way to stymie hateful tribalism in the media is not to legislation, but often very minor actions taken by us. I would argue two primary actions should be taken; firstly, one should view media from across the political spectrum; secondly, one should engage in discussion with those you disagree with. As Zachary Wood explained in a Ted Talk, tuning out opposing viewpoints doesn't make them go away, because millions of people agree with them. In order to understand the potential of society to progress forward, we need to understand the counterforces. People increasingly do not interact with ideas they oppose, and in doing so they lose an understanding of those ideas and come to regard their opponents as what is known as strawmen, as Krysta Scripter explains Especially when we hold a strong opinion, it's increasingly less likely that we're talking [..] with anyone who disagrees. Interaction with those we disagree with also fosters intellectual humility, defined by the Journal of Positive Psychology as the ability to have an accurate view of ones intellectual strengths and limitations and the ability to negotiate ideas in a fair and inoffensive manner.  It has been shown that this intellectual humility can not only improve ones learning abilities, but their social skills as well. 
The engagement with others ideas also reinforces the ideal of pluralism, which is often considering an underpinning of democracy. Pluralism, defined by Oxford as a condition or system in which two or more states, groups, principles, sources of authority, etc., coexist., allows for a democracy in which diverse ideas are expected to compete, if we cannot coexist with others, we cannot properly function as a democracy. For instance, Marwan Muasher, a Middle Eastern policy expert at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, argues that a lack of pluralism has been a defining factor in the destabilization of many areas in the Middle East. By interacting with others, we are learning for ourselves while helping support the foundations of democracy.
 System of the Fringes:
The factors contributing to partisanship can be traced to the very roots of our electoral systems themselves. Closed partisan primaries, gerrymandering, and our first past the post voting system collaborate to enable a vocal minority of extremists to hold final sway over our electoral process. Only a small percentage of eligible voters even bother to vote in primaries, and these are commonly the most extreme of the electorate. As former U.S Representative Mickey Edwards(R-OK) notes, only 8% of the total Alabama electorate voted for far-right Judge Roy Moore over incumbent Senator Luther Stranged in the 2017 Republican special election primary, and Strange was by all means more popular among the general electorate than Moore, yet it was Moore who advanced to the general election. In Nebraskas Second Congressional District progressive Democrat Kara Eastman lost to Republican Don Bacon by 4.8% even as Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden carried the district by nearly 6 points; Eastmans moderate Democratic primary opponent Ann Ashford would have been very likely to win the seat. Candidates such as Moore or Eastman are able to win primaries, and thus advance to be one of two, or even the only, competitive candidate in a general election by appealing to small yet vocal aspects of the electorate. The bottom line is clear: primaries do not represent the electorate. 
The second issue I would cite is gerrymandering, which is closely connected to the first. Gerrymandering, named for Vice President Elbridge Gerrye, is a practice in which legislatures draw legislative districts in such a way as to maximize the benefits of one political party; Gerrymandering has been a persistent issue throughout American history, but it has become more significant than ever as of late. Competitive elections are a cornerstone of democracy yet Gerrymandering reduces the value of elections while removing competition, allowing politicians to become increasingly radical without facing serious electoral hurdles. A study by Antoine Yoshinaka and Chad Murphy found that members of the out-of-power party tended to have more drastic changes made to their districts as a way for the in-power party to insulate its members. For instance, as the Brenna Center for Justices notes that gerrymandering in Maryland removed Republican Roscoe Bartlett in 2012. Marylands gerrymandering also means that (relatively) far left Representatives such as Kweisi Mfume and (relatively) far right Representative Andy Harris are both consistently re-elected by large margins; ideally both districts would overlap with more significant support for the other party and ensure competitive elections. Furthermore, if congressional districts were drawn to ensure and encourage competition, the congressional balance would be taken out of the hands of a small number of voters in swing districts. Some would argue that this would allow parties to seize supermajorities, I would disagree as in a congressional map drawn to be as competitive as possible it is unlikely that any party would be able to win all of the competitive seats, and if this were to happen the party would have to have moved to the center enough that it would represent the majority will. 
Thirdly, our first past the post voting system is flawed. The system allows for phenomena such as vote splitting and allows candidates to win with small shares of the vote, as low as under 30% in some primaries or 35% in general elections. This system allows candidates to succeed with wedges of the public and disempowers third parties. For instance, in 1974 former U.S Representative Ray Blanton won the Democratic primary with 22.7% of the vote, Blanton would defeat Republican Lamar Alexander in the general election but his single term as Governor would be marred by scandal and RealClearPolitics would name him one of the Ten Most Corrupt Politicians in American history, in the final days of his governorship, he would infamously pardon two dozen convicted murderers and 28 others in exchange for money.
Great political leaders of the past-LBJ, Sam Rayburn, Howard Baker, Bob Dolef-understood the importance of compromise, and only through that understanding were they able to achieve the legislative reforms they did, yet legislative leaders today stifle the legislative process and focus instead on their own interests, putting party above democracy. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell(R-KY) has long been known as a master of legislative obstruction not seen since the days of James Alleng, while Representative Justin Amash has said of Speaker Nancy Pelosis tactics We have not been allowed to offer amendments on the House floor in more than four years. In effect, every bill we vote on is take it or leave it.. That being said, there are still those who value compromise, such as Senator Diane Feinstein(D-CA) or retiring Senator Lamar Alexander(R-TN), but our legislative leaders, enabled by primaries and our voting system, largely stymie attempts at compromise.
A Framework for Unity:
The majority of Americans are exhausted with partisan tribalism. Most Americans are not far right or far left, yet both sides maintain caricatures of one another, and an increasing number of Americans confine themselves to partisan-not necessarily ideological-echo chambers that fail to provide them with the support for pluralism and understanding of opposing views that is critical to democracy. I argue that three crucial electoral reforms should be instituted, a commission to end gerrymandering, a blanket primary, and ranked choice voting. 
States have consistently altered their primary systems since Robert La Follette popularized the idea in the early 1900s, one, Indiana, went farther. Indiana was a hotbed of the  Klux Klan during the organizations second wave and officials as influential as the states Governor were members of the terrorist group. Members of the Klan were significantly more likely to vote in primaries than any other group and could seize control of the political system due to their high turnout rates in these primaries, this led Indiana to largely do away with the primary system for local elections in 1928; they would not be restored until the mid 1970s. That being noted, I would not advocate for the abolition of primaries, instead I would argue for abolishing the partisan requirements tied to primaries. States such as Vermont allow one to choose whether to vote in the Republican or Democratic primaries in the state regardless of party affiliation, allowing independents and others into the fold and enabling the primary to be more representative.
That being said, some have gone farther and instituted the now largely forgotten blanket primary, which I would argue would be the best alternative. A blanket primary system allows voters to vote in any partys primary for different offices, with the candidate with the best showing from each party advancing to the general election, : this system commonly produced consensus candidates. Washington and Alaska long maintained a blanket primary system, which contributed to both states being quite competitive, as liberal Republicans such as Daniel Evans won in the generally Democratic state of Washington. A blanket primary was adopted by California in the 1996, but the Supreme Court overruled decades of precedent in the 2001 decision California Democratic Party v. Jones and deemed the blanket primary unconstitutional. The reasoning in this decision, put forth by Justice Scalia in a 7-2 decisionh, was that parties can govern their own affairs; I would disagree and argue that this falls out of the scope of a party affair and would posit that it is an affair of the people and furthermore argue the decision was a violation of states rights. As Justice Stevens puts it in his dissent A State's power to determine how its officials are to be elected is a quintessential attribute of sovereignty.
Secondly how can gerrymandering be stymied, and how should we redraw the maps? I would suggest one of two solutions, either an algorithm or a nonpartisan committee to redistrict. I would argue congressional maps are best drawn in a manner that would ensure the highest number of competitive districts. FiveThirtyEight, a polling and analysis website ran by Nate Silver, recently released a series of 8 congressional maps gerrymandered in various ways, one of these is drawn to maximize competition. The maximized competition map includes 242 highly competitive districts, this ensures that ones vote is likely to have a significant impact while ensuring that elections are not confined to several dozen congressional districts, practically disenfranchising large portions of the electorate. As David Daley of the electoral reform organization FairVote notes If your goal is to reduce polarization, this system would reduce the oversized influence of partisan voters in low-turnout primaries, give moderate and independent voters more choices, and empower the broader electorate that turns out in November general elections
Finally, how we can reform our voting system itself. Several ideas have gained popularity, including approval voting (utilized in Bismarck, North Dakota), but by and large the most popular is ranked choice voting, Maine uses ranked choice voting in its elections, and Alaska recently approved a referendum to do so as well. Ranked choice voting would allow people to rank every candidate for an office in order of preference, candidates are eliminated in each round and their votes redistributed to their second choice until a candidate possesses a majority vote. The majority requirement ensures that candidates possess a true mandate for their policies: other effects of ranked choice voting include more moderate candidates as candidates are required to appeal to a larger segment of the electorate, less tribalism and a more civil political culture as candidates are competing for the second or third choice votes of those who may support another candidate as their first-choice vote, and the negation of the spoiler effect. 
Opponents of ranked-choice voting make several arguments, well summarized in the Heritage Foundation piece Ranked Choice Voting Is A Bad Choice but the primary argument is the claim that in a ranked-choice system, one could vote for a candidate they greatly dislike, whom they ranked quite low. I would object vehemently to this argument. Firstly, one would never vote for the candidate they ranked last, and if one were not comfortable voting for multiple candidates they could leave them out of their rankings. Secondly, one will only vote for a candidate ranked low on their ballot if the election is down to that candidate and the candidate or candidates one has ranked lower. For example, if one were to have ranked every third-party presidential candidate above Joe Biden and Donald Trump in this election but still ranked Biden above Trump, their vote would have gone to their second least favored candidate, but only because the alternative was a candidate they favored even less.
Our political system is in chaos, and technologies such as social media exacerbate these issues. Electoral reform and reforms to our manner of politics are, frankly, the only way we can escape this political quagmire for brighter pastures.
 
Footnotes:
a.. The four acts of political courage I reference here are as follows; Wayne Morse(D-OR) being one of two Senators to oppose the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution; James Buckley(R/C-NY) being the first conservative Senator to call for the resignation of President Nixon; Appointed Senator Charles Goodell(R-NY) opposing the Vietnam War, an action which led to his defeat in the 1970 election, losing the support even of the Nixon White House; and Republican Senate Leader Howard Baker(R-TN) aiding President Carter with negotiations surrounding the Panama Canal, which may have cost him the 1980 Republican presidential nomination.
b. Father Charles Coughlin was a radio priest from the late 1930s and early 1940s infamous for his advocacy for, arguably, fascist policies and for sympathizing with the enemy during WWII, his weekly broadcasts attracted millions of listeners until he was removed from air early in WWII, although he continued to preside over his church until his death in the late 1970s.
c. The strawman fallacy is defined by Wikipedia as a form of argument and an informal fallacy of having the impression of refuting an argument, whereas the proper idea of argument under discussion was not addressed or properly refuted.
d. I would note that Senator Strange was an appointed incumbent, but an incumbent nonetheless, and one who had demonstrated relative popularity with the general electorate in the past before.
e. Gerry was Governor of Massachusetts at the time of the redistricting, and in fairness to him, he was reluctant to support the redistricting bill. The term gerrymander comes from a political cartoon soon after the bill was passed.
f. LBJ refers to Lyndon Baines Johnson, I refer more so to his work as Senate Majority Leader from 1953-1960 than to his work in the Presidency. Sam Rayburn, the longest serving Speaker of the House in American history, was LBJs counterpart from 1953-1960 and served as Speaker until his death in 1961, both Texans, Rayburn was a significant influence on LBJ and in some ways served as a father figure. Howard Baker served as Republican Senate Leader from 1977-`985, the last four of those years at Majority Leader. Bob Dole served as Bakers successor, both were influential legislators who valued bipartisanship.
g. James Jim Allen served as a Senator from Alabama from 1969-1977 and was an infamous master of senate rules. Allens behavior almost single handedly led to the lowering of the filibuster threshold from 67 votes to 60, I would recommend Walter Mondaless account of the matter, which may be found in his memoir, The Good Fight.
h. Justices Ginsburg and Stevens dissented.

"3581"," ""The transportation secretary Pete Buttigieg delivered a blunt warning on Sunday to Joe Manchin and other Senate Democrats who are forcing Joe Biden to [scale back his climate crisis agenda](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/oct/15/bidens-clean-electricity-program-could-be-dropped-from-spending-bill-report): your resistance is going to cost lives.... 

Buttigieg appeared to express his disappointment in Manchins stance on Sunday, telling CNNs State of the Union that the holdout politicians stonewalling of Bidens ambitious climate plan could be deadly.

The longer you take to do something about it, the more its going to cost in livelihoods as well as lives, he said.

The administration and the president are committed to bold climate action, exactly what legislative form that takes is whats being negotiated right now. But the bottom line is we have to act on climate for the good of our children and for the good of our economy. This is kind of like a planetary maintenance issue. ""
